There was a very small boy called Mwanga in the new class. And Nguri, the well-known fat coward of the senior class made this little boy completely his slave. He even went as far as taking half the food from mwanga`s plate and heaping it on its own, to fatten further his already too fat cheeks. Word got round of this latest wickedness and Namunyu, one of the senior boys, heard about it.Namunyu went to see the little boy in the dormitory across from his to talk to him. But the boy would not talk. He simply cried and cried. In crying, he reminded Namunyu of his younger brothers at home and he burnt with anger. It wasn`t so bad if the very next meal Namunyu changed places with another boy and sat at the same table with Mwanga and the gluttonous Nguri. Questions were asked about the change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">&quot;I am a senior, am I not? And big men can do anything,&quot; Namunyu gave his explanation, a remark that set the table laughing and brought the teacher on duty towards them. But all was quiet when she got there. By this time Nguri was examining Mwanga`s plate with popping eyes. &quot;Servant&quot;&nbsp;he said to Mwanga, &quot;let me relieve you of your heavy load.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">So saying, Nguri stretched out his hand and grabbed Mwanga`s plate. Tears filled the little boy&rsquo;s eyes as he got back almost empty plate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Members of the table were laughing, calling Nguri names as they did at every meal. Namuyu waited till Nguri had filled his mouth, and then he rose abruptly and smacked him hard across both cheeks. Food jumped from the stuffed mouth and splattered all over the table. Namunyu gave him another one across the nose and another right on the teeth. The table was in an uproar. Mwanga&#39;s eyes danced with joy. Nguri was up, gasping. <em>The teacher was with them in no time but too late to save </em><em>Nguri</em><em> from the blows.</em> The other boys were holding on to Namunyu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">&quot;Let me get at the beast! Leave me alone!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Nguri went to hide behind the teacher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">As the teacher got the two boys dragged out of the room, Namunyu pushed the whole plateful of Nguri`s food towards Mwanga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">&quot;He is not a member of our table,&quot; protested Nguri.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">&quot;Just because you are heartless do you think all of us are ready to watch you mistreat a little boy?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Fights were prohibited, but after listening to the story and getting Mwanga`s side of it, the teacher wasn`t very surprised that Namunyu was so angry. She simply warned Namunyu against any future fighting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">For the rest of the term &#39;monos&#39;&nbsp;had a special smile for Namunyu and offered to help him with everything he had to do. And the joke that had been on the &#39;monos&#39; was turned on Nguri. Day after day the story of how food jumped out of his mouth and how he hid behind the teacher was retold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">At the end of the term, Mwanga saw Namunyu walking towards the gate.

You need practical information about different fabrics so that you can shop wisely and dress well. Fabrics vary in strength, warmth, washability and so on. There are three main things that give them these characteristics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">The most important factor is the fibre or fibres from which the fabric is made. Some fibres are strong and make a strong yarn and fabric while others are weak and give a weak fabric. Next in importance, is the type of yarn made from the fibre. Is it thin or thick, tightly or loosely twisted? A tightly twisted yarn, for example, will be stronger than a loosely twisted one. Lastly, the way the fabric is made must be examined. Which type of weaving or knitting has been used? A thick fluffy cloth will be warmer than a thin smooth fabric made of the same fibre.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">One function of clothes is to help keep the temperature of the body at about <span class="math-tex">\\(37^\\circ\\)</span>C (<span class="math-tex">\\(98.4{^\\circ}F\\)</span> ). Therefore, in cold weather, the heat produced by the body must not be allowed to escape, but in warm weather and during exercise the body needs to lose heat to prevent the body temperature from rising. For cold weather, it is sensible to choose a fabric which retains heat, which does not &lsquo;conduct&rsquo; heat away from the body. Air is an insulator&nbsp;and any fabric which traps a lot of air between the threads and against your skin will be warm, as well as being light. The amount of air in a fabric is the most important factor in determining its warmth. In addition, some fibres themselves are good conductors of heat. A good example of these is linen. Other fibres like wool and silk are poor conductors of heat. Wool is also a crimped or wavy fibre, so that air is always trapped in woollen yarns and fabrics and makes them warm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">For clothes to stay smart they must not crease easily and become baggy and shapeless. This is particularly &nbsp;important for clothes which are worn every day. However, it matters less for clothes which are worn for a few hours. Fabrics which do not crease easily are called resilient - one of the best examples is silk, which if <em>crumpled </em>into a tight ball in the palm of your hand will spring out increased when released.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">It is&nbsp;<em>common knowledge</em> that some fabrics get dirty faster than others. Clothes with smooth finishes stay clean longest. Hairy, rough or fluffy surfaces pick up the dirt which is caught on the minute hairs of the fibres. Linen fibres are long and smooth, making smooth threads and smooth fabrics which remain clean longer. Wool fibres have rough scales on them, so that the fabrics always get dirty faster than linen ones under similar conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Another factor that should be considered in choosing clothing is safety. Many children and adults are injured and some killed each year from burning clothing. Children&rsquo;s clothes, particularly nightwear and party clothes should be made from material which does not catch fire or which will only do so with difficulty&nbsp;and will not flare up. In this category of materials are wool, silk, thin nylon fabrics with &#39;safe from fire&#39; labels and flame-proofed cotton.</p>\r\n',created:"2016-09-26T12:18:32.268443Z",subject:3,exam:26}],name:"English KCPE

They were friends no longer. Anansi set traps and hid them in the grass near the berries on which Kling Kling loved to feed. He got some fibre from the forest and made long, slippery nooses and hid them where Kling Kling loved to walk. <em>But it was no use.</em> Kling Kling saw all the traps and avoided them. Sometimes he would hide in the branches of a tree and, without a sound, watch Anansi set a trap. Then when it was all done he would suddenly cry out &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; and fly away, leaving Anansi puzzled and angry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At last Anansi went to his friend Tiger, and said: &quot;I beg you, Mr. Tiger, help me to catch that old Kling Kling bird. He wouldn&rsquo;t pay his fine. He flew away, and I cannot catch him at all.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;And what will you give me if I help you catch him?&quot; asked Tiger. &quot;Oh, my sweet Tiger,&quot; said Anansi, &quot;I will give you a cow.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A whole cow!&quot; exclaimed Tiger, who was very greedy and very fond of beef.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A whole cow, Mr. Tiger. I promise,&quot; said Anansi. So Tiger thought and thought for a long time and at last he said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we will do, Mr. Anansi. I will lie down in the house and pretend to be dead. You must take a bell and walk all around the town calling out at the top of your voice: &ldquo;The great King Tiger is dead; the great King Tiger is dead.&rdquo; Then all the people will come to the funeral, and you can catch him.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now the next day was a great market day. Kling Kling went to the market and bought peas and rice and fish and plantain and sweet potatoes. While he was buying the sweet potatoes he heard a bell ringing, and he asked the people what it was. &nbsp;&quot;Ah,&quot; said a stout market-woman, &quot;the great King Tiger is dead.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;What! You mean that Tiger, the great Tiger, is dead?&rsquo; asked Kling Kling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the people standing around, &quot;yes, what she says is true. The great King Tiger is dead.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And when did he die?&quot; asked Kling Kling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yesterday just before twelve o&rsquo;clock.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Then,&quot; cried Kling Kling, &quot;I must hurry away to put on my second-best coat and go to the funeral.&quot; Kling Kling rushed home and put on his second-best two-tailed blue coat and his shoes that were so new that they cried out quee-quee&rsquo; when he walked in them. He finished dressing and went to Tiger&rsquo;s home. When he got there he saw <em>a great crowd of people </em>outside, and he shook his head and said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So the great King Tiger is dead!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; they replied, &quot;the great King Tiger is dead.&rsquo;&quot;&lsquo;When did he die?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yesterday just before twelve,&quot; they replied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What killed him? Was it fever? Was it an accident? How did he die?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The heat of the weather killed him,&quot; they said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And has he laughed at all since he died&quot;&rsquo; asked Kling Kling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Then he isn&#39;t dead at all,&quot; said Kling Kling. &quot;Don&#39;t you know that a man is not dead until he laughs a big laugh?&quot; Tiger was in the nearest room, listening at the window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he heard what Kling Kling said he broke out into a great laugh that shook the house, and Kling Kling said, &quot;Ha-ha, I never yet heard a dead man laugh!&quot; and he flew away.

She carefully hid the gifts she received or kept them at her friend&rsquo;s house. Her friend Rachel took her to the Family Planning Clinic to get an injection so that she would not become pregnant. In exchange for keeping quiet about Maria&rsquo;s secret sugar-daddy, Rachael was allowed to wear the clothes and jewellery Dan gave Maria. Maria lived for Saturdays. Life went by so slowly during the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One evening, Mrs. Mungai, Maria&rsquo;s mother came home from the hospital looking very depressed. &quot;Aai, these AIDS babies,&quot; she wailed, as she pushed her food away. She had no appetite. &quot;They break my heart.&quot; &quot;What sort of babies?&quot; asked her son David, curiously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;AIDS babies are babies that are born to die,&quot; Gladys answered. &quot;Their mothers have AIDS.&quot; &quot;What is AIDS?&quot; asked Maria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s a terrible disease, Maria,&quot; said Mrs. Mungai. &quot;It has no cure.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You mean it&rsquo;s like cancer?&quot; David asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, it&rsquo;s only like cancer because there isn&rsquo;t a cure,&quot; &nbsp;Mrs. Mungai explained. &quot;It starts with a virus called HIV. This HIV makes your body weaker and weaker, so it can&rsquo;t protect itself from disease anymore. Then you can catch any disease and die from it. Even a simple disease like the flu.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;How do you get this HIV?&quot; asked Maria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, the most common way of getting it is by having sex with an infected partner.&quot; Maria stopped eating. She stared at her mother. She suddenly felt very frightened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We shouldn&rsquo;t talk about these things at the&nbsp;table. I think we should change the subject,&quot; Mr. Mungai said &quot;No, dear,&quot; &nbsp;protested&nbsp;Mrs.Mungai, touching her husband&rsquo;s&nbsp;arm.&nbsp;This is an important subject. Our children should become aware of it.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We are already learning about HIV/AIDS in school,&quot; said Gladys, &quot;Mrs, Chelimo told us all about it. She says the most dangerous thing about it is that you can&rsquo;t tell by looking at someone if he or she has got HIV or not.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maria stared at her plate in silence. Her face felt very hot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But how do babies get it?&quot; David asked. &quot;I mean babies do not have sex!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If a woman has HIV, then the virus is in her blood. She passes it on to the baby before it is born. Then the little thing doesn&rsquo;t have a chance. It gets ill so easily, and such a baby usually dies before its second birthday. Another one died today at the hospital. It&rsquo;s so sad.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maria was very quiet. She had hardly heard what her mother had said about AIDS babies. She didn&rsquo;t feel like eating anymore. Her stomach felt strange with fear. She and Dan had had sex many times. Did Dan have HIV? Was she going to die of AIDS? Suddenly, having a sugar-daddy didn&rsquo;t seem such a grown-up thing anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The things Maria heard that day really shocked her. But she made a decision and she was going to stick to it; she would have nothing to do with Dan from that day on. She also resolved to warn all her friends about the risks of living a careless sex life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:right">(Adapted from <em>The Yellow Dress </em>by Gladys

I only knew one thing: I thought I was going crazy. I felt different from everyone else. I could not seem to develop close relationships with people. I did not have many close friends. None of my social relationships lasted longer than a few days or a couple of weeks at the most. I felt insecure and unsure of myself in social situations and at school. I did not have confidence in my abilities. My parents seemed to confirm this by their constant complaints. My father was an alcoholic, and his illness affected us all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">One of my most vivid memories is about an incident that occurred when I was in Standard Five. My parents had been fighting, which usually happened whenever my father had been drinking. As their voices grew louder, their tone became more abusive. I was huddled in a bedroom with two of my sisters, neither of them whom wanted to believe that there was anything wrong. I prayed that the fight would involve neither of my brothers nor sisters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Suddenly I heard louder noises and screaming. It sounded as if something terrible was happening. My mother had been on the receiving end of my father&rsquo;s temper many a times. Now I was afraid she was being hurt &hellip; no, I was actually afraid my father was going to kill her. I raced out of the bedroom to stop the fight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I came into the kitchen, I saw what had caused all the noise. My father had overturned a cupboard full of pots and pans and they were all over the floor. He was screaming at my mother, who just stood there taking his abuse and not trying to stop him. I jumped between them trying to shut the insults my father was pouring at me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Stop it, just stop it!&rdquo; I yelled, I think, at both of them. My father grabbed my arm in a drunken rage. My mother tried to protect me and grabbed onto my other arm. They pulled me from opposite directions, and my father screamed, &ldquo;Okay, who do you love?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">These problems went on for years and it made our home miserable. Then one day my father came home and announced that he would never drink again. We looked at each other, doubt written all over our faces. He noticed our reaction and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious. I know how much suffering I have caused you and I&rsquo;m sorry. I have joined an organization that will help me to overcome this problem.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">With tears in our eyes, we got up and hugged him affectionately. My mother was so excited that she wept and laughed for a long time. She embraced him and the glitter in her eyes told us that she still loved him. And do you know? My father kept his word.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Adapted from The purposeful Writer by Donna Gorrell)</p>\r\n',created:"2016-09-26T12:51:14.741564Z",subject:3,exam:28},{id:57,name:"KCPE 2002 Passage 2 Eng",statement:'<p dir="ltr"><em><u>Read the following passage and then answer question 39 to 50.</u></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Hearing impairment or deafness can either be total or partial. People who begin to go deaf in adult life have different problems from those who are born with a hearing impairment. They have to learn different ways of behaving and different ways of communicating, perhaps at a time when learning is not at all easy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Such people have to learn how to use a hearing aid although the device is not a complete solution to their problem. The sound perceived by the hearing impaired person through the hearing aid is distorted and appears to have more background noise than is heard by someone with normal hearing. In addition, the hearing impaired have to look at the movement of the speaker&rsquo;s lips in order to understand what the speaker is saying. This is called lip-reading. Lip-reading is difficult; it demands intense concentration, and an uninterrupted direct view of the speaker&rsquo;s face. No other activities can take place at the same time: the lip-reader has to stop eating, stop washing up, stop mending, stop everything in order to concentrate on &lsquo;hearing&rsquo;. This may make them appear stupid to the ignorant. However, it is not a question of stupidity, but a way of ensuring the lip-reader does not misunderstand the message. Imagine what it is like trying to communicate to someone in a very noisy classroom. Frustrating, isn&rsquo;t it? The hearing impaired have to face that all the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">As a useful way of looking at the problem is to see the hearing impaired person as a foreigner and to treat him or her as if you were in a foreign country. This means that you have to speak more clearly and raise your voice slightly. You have to use gestures in order to make the meaning clear and also to be ready to use pencil and paper to be absolutely certain. It is also important to make sure that you do not obscure your mouth with your hand or any other object.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Another point quite often forgotten is that a hearing aid may be quite useful in a quiet room. But try it on a busy street, in a noisy market, bus or classroom and you have a really difficult problem distinguishing speech. So do not suggest or even encourage hearing impaired people to go to functions which are going to make disability appear worse and thus increase their sense of failure. This does not mean that the hearing impaired should be cut off from social activities. On the contrary, you can carefully select for them entertainment places with good sound systems. Also choose the best seating locations so that their hearing is enhanced rather than hindered. Making sure that the people talking are clearly seen will also help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p

She said rude children were a shame to their parents, and could bring ill-fortune to themselves. She insisted that adults had to be addressed with respect as &ldquo;mother&rdquo; of &ldquo;father of so and so, &ldquo;uncle&rdquo; or &ldquo;aunt&rdquo; as appropriate. We never took seriously until one of us learnt a lesson the hard way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">One day my brother Tope, three of my cousins and I were playing our favorite game of hide and seek. Everybody else had been discovered easily except Tope. We had totally failed to locate him until a stranger came along. To our amazement, he stopped and seemed to be talking to a big tree by the path. We moved closer and heard him say, &ldquo;Please show me where the shopping mall is.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">It was then that we heard Tope tell the stranger, &ldquo;Ssshh! Go away. You&rsquo;ll make them discover where I am.&rdquo; We all started shouting, &ldquo;Tope, we have found you at last!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Tope angrily sprang out of his hiding place. The stranger was now confused.&rdquo; Where is the shopping center?&rdquo; he asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Tope gave him angry look and shouted, &ldquo;Crooked legs, the shopping Centre is up here in my nostrils.&rdquo; My cousins burst out laughing while the stranger stood there shocked at such misconduct. It was then that Grandmother&rsquo;s words came to my mind. Not sure of what my playmates would say, I hesitantly gave the stranger the direction to the shopping Centre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; he said and walked away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">A week later Tope and his friends went to pick mangoes. They had collected some when they realized that the biggest and ripest were at the topmost part of one of the trees. None of the children was willing to climb up to this part; the height was simply scaring. They tried to bring down the mangoes by hitting them with stones but they kept missing. They had almost given up when Tope volunteered to climb up the tree. The others watched in disbelief as their hero climbed higher and higher. As soon as he got to the top of the tree, he started throwing down the juicy mangoes to the excited children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Suddenly a branch broke and Tope fell down with a thud. There was total confusion; some children ran away clutching the mangoes, while some stood by and watched helplessly. Tope lay on the ground groaning in pain. He had broken his leg. Luckily, some people who were passing by saw him and rushed him to hospital. At the hospital, Tope shouted to anybody in white uniform,&rdquo; please help me I don&rsquo;t want to die!&rdquo; Calm down, the doctor will see you in a minute,&rdquo; a nurse told him as she gently put him on a bed. Just then, a doctor came into the room and immediately recognizes the patient. This was the boy who had been very rude to him a week earlier. The doctor started mimicking Tope.&rdquo; please help me! Help me! I don&rsquo;t want to die&rdquo; It was then that the truth dawn to Tope. He passed out not so much from the pain but from the shock. When he came to his senses, his leg was neatly plastered. Grandmother and the doctor were standing over him with kind smiles on their faces.</p>\r\n',created:"2016-09-27T11:46:01.845760Z",subject:3,exam:29},{id:60,name:"KCPE 2003 Passage 2 Eng",statement:'<p dir="ltr"><u><em>Read the following passage and then anwer questions 26-38.</em></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Many people take sodas and yet have never stopped to think what is in them. Well, maybe they should. The manufactures of soft drinks use little quantities of a chemical &ndash; ethylene glycol, popularly known as anti-freeze in the drinks. This chemical prevents water from freezing at the normal temperatures of <span class="math-tex">\\(0^\\circ\\)</span>C. This in effect means that the drink can remain liquid even down to levels of <span class="math-tex">\\(- 40^\\circ\\)</span>&nbsp;C or <span class="math-tex">\\(-50^\\circ\\)</span>C. They refer to this as &ldquo;really chill.&rdquo; The chemical, ethylene glycol, is a slow poison. If a person drinks four liters of soda, this could be their last drink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, manufactures use carbon dioxide in liquid form to preserve the drinks. After a soda drinking contest at a University in India, the winner, who had downed eight bottles, fainted on the spot. The reason was that there was too much carbon dioxide in his blood. Needless to say, sodas were banned in that particular institution as a result. No one would advise anybody to drink carbon dioxide</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">For most soft drinks the acid level measures around 3-4 on the acidity scale. This amount of acidity is strong enough to dissolve bones and teeth. In one experiment, a famous brand of cola dissolved a whole broken tooth after ten days! Soft drinks contain no nutritional value. On the contrary, they have a high sugar content, carbonic and phosphoric acid, a variety of chemicals, flavorings and colorings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">The practice of taking cold drinks after a meal is particularly not advisable. Our body needs at least a temperature of <span class="math-tex">\\(37^\\circ\\)</span>C for the digestive enzymes to function. The temperature of cold drinks is close to <span class="math-tex">\\(0^\\circ\\)</span>C. This will reduce the effectiveness of the enzymes, thus making digestion difficult. Instead of the food getting digested, it circulates in the blood stream and is carried to the whole body. Hence toxic substances collect in other parts of the body, causing a variety of diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">People may not stop drinking sodas altogether but they can reduce the amount they take or switch to alternatives. Fresh juices and plain water are healthful and people should be encouraged to get used to them early in life. By the way, the artificial juices(squashes) found in shops are no better than sodas. It takes a certain amount of courage to say no but everybody will eventually be glad that they took the healthier option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr"><em>(adapted from &ldquo;Kenya police Review,&rdquo;

Already it had history. It had been Waiyaki&rsquo;s idea and even now he could not understand fully how his ideas had borne fruit so quickly. He saw it as something beyond himself, something arranged by fate. Event had followed event in quick succession,&nbsp;quickening the rhythm of life in the hills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">His father&rsquo;s death had almost numbed him. He could not Tell why, but Chege&rsquo;s death, though not unexpected, came as a shock to him. It seemed unfair that Chege should have died at that particular time. He should have lived longer. And Waiyaki had gone on like a man drugged, not knowing what to think or do. He had all of a sudden become a grown man. He was now on his own. It was while he was in this mood that the idea of schools had come to him. But what could he do, he being so young? And what happened meant that he would never go back to school himself. His time to work and serve the people had come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Waiyaki regarded starting schools through self-help efforts as a kind of mission. It was a vision which he followed with hope and passion. He travelled from ridge to ridge, all over the country of the sleeping lions. He found a willing people. Yes, the ridges were beginning to awake. The trees, the birds and the paths he trod, all knew him, knew a man determined to serve his country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Schools sprang up like mushrooms. Often a school was nothing more than a shed hurriedly thatched with grass. This work of building together was a tribute to the people&rsquo;s way of co-operation. It was a determination to have something of their own making fired by their own imagination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The schools were overflowing with children, hungry for education. A class held many children crammed together. Their teachers, any who could be grabbed from Siriana, sat in front and the expectant little eyes looked up to them, wanting to drink in his learning and wisdom. People would feel proud, very proud, when a son or daughter came in the evening clutching exercise books and pencils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">The children caught the enthusiasm of their parents. Perhaps they saw they were the hope and glory of the society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Waiyaki was the head teacher of Marioshoni. He went there in the morning and went back home in the evening. It was nearly always like that. He liked it. The walk gave him time to think about many of problems connected with education. He wanted to do a lot for all, and serve faithfully. He was proud of the small role he had played in awakening the hills, the sleeping lions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>\r\n',created:"2016-09-15T11:03:34.403186Z",subject:3,exam:30},{id:54,name:"KCPE 2004 Passage 2",statement:'<p dir="ltr"><u><em>Read the passage below and then answer questions.</em></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">The children&rsquo;s act seeks to cater for children&rsquo;s interests by making provisions for their protection by parents. This, however, is only one among the objectives of the Act. In the act, parents are expected to exercise parental responsibility. This means all the duties, rights, power and authority which a parent has over a child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Who, according to the Act. Has parental responsibility? More than one person may have parental responsibility for the same child at the same time. But a person, who acquires that responsibility for a child at anytime, shall not cease to have it. The responsibility cannot be surrendered or transferred to another individual. The Act; however; allows for some or all the parental responsibility to be exercised by another person on the parent&rsquo;s behalf</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Parental responsibility can, in some cases be withdrawn by an order of court. A child can apply to have parental responsibility terminated. This could be in cases of child abuse including sexual abuse, physical violence and denial of basic human needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">All parents have a duty to maintain a child and in particular to provide the children with a balanced diet in order to ensure that they grow up healthy and strong and do not succumb to illness. Children are also entitled to adequate shelter, clothing and medical care. Knowledge is the key to success and parents should make sure their children attend school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">It is possible for a person to have the care and control of a child without legal parental responsibility. Such a person is expected to do what is reasonable in order to safeguard and promote the child&rsquo;s welfare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">The Act has reserved some basic rights to parents; these include the right to give parental guidance in religious, moral, social and cultural values. The way a child is brought up will to a large extent depend on what the parents believe in. They must ensure that their beliefs are in the best interests of the child. Parents have the rights to determine the name of a child. While different cultures ascribe to a variety of naming methods, a parent has the final say on the name of a child.</p>\r\n',created:"2016-09-15T11:05:25.700419Z",subject:3,exam:30}],name:"English

He ruled the jungle so wisely that all the animals loved and obeyed him. That&rsquo;s why at the beginning of every year, they all came to him to pay their rent. They came&nbsp;from the rocks, caves, trees, holes, rivers, nests, mountains and valleys. They paraded before the king as he decided how much rent each would pay. The amount was always fair and no one ever complained - no one but the crocodile who brought nothing but his bad temper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new year was here and the animals of the jungle all came to pay their rent. As usual, the crocodile was unwilling to comply, but the king was unwilling to relent and insisted that the crocodile paid the ten shillings due for living in the water. Since the king was kind he gave the crocodile until later in the year to pay his rent. The crocodile then went on his way, grumbling. The last animal to come before the king was the tiniest monkey, whom the king required to pay ten cents for living in the tallest tree. The monkey paid his rent promptly and was soon on his way home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he reached the end of the path near his palm tree by the river, he had an awful feeling in the pit of his stomach. He was about to scamper up his tree when he was overcome by a great sense of fear. &ldquo;Is anyone there?&rdquo; He timidly asked, hoping that no one would answer. He peered into the dark grass and there, peering back, were the two most dreadful eyes in the jungle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just then, the crocodile responded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your friend the crocodile. I have been waiting for you as I want to give you a ride across the river. I have something nice to show you.&rdquo; The monkey&rsquo;s mind went blank and before it began working again he was hunched wetly on the crocodile&rsquo;s back, floating out into the wide river. His teeth were chattering and his tail was tangled in three big knots. Near the middle of the river, the crocodile began to submerge himself into the water. The only dry place left for the poor frightened monkey to sit was on the crocodile&rsquo;s head, right around the corner of his mouth. It was at this time that the crocodile demanded ten shillings for the ride. Knowing very well that the monkey would not raise it. The monkey informed the crocodile that he had just paid his last ten cents as rent. The crocodile was adamant. He threatened that if the monkey did not pay, he would eat him up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The monkey then had a brilliant idea. He remembered just how much crocodiles love to eat kidneys. He giggled in excitement and told the crocodile, &ldquo;Oh, what a shame! It just goes to show how little you know about monkeys.&rdquo; When the crocodile inquired what he meant, the monkey asked, &ldquo;Do you really want to eat me without my kidneys? Don&rsquo;t you know that Mondays are monkeys&#39; washing day, and as such, I have washed and polished my kidneys and left them in the sun to dry?&rdquo; He further explained that he had been about to go up his tree to pop them back in when he encountered the crocodile. The monkey went on to add that if the crocodile returned him to his tree, he would get the kidneys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crocodile, though large in body, was <strong>small in brain</strong>. When he thought of the newly washed monkey kidneys-all pink, fresh, shiny and tasty looking, <strong>he could not resist</strong>. He therefore, agreed to the monkey&rsquo;s request. After getting back to the tree, the monkey sweetly told the crocodile, &quot;Before I come down, open your mouth wide to receive my kidneys. They will give you appetite to eat the rest of me.&rdquo; The crocodile obliged and the monkey threw down the biggest and hardest coconut he would find on the palm tree. The coconut landed right into the crocodile&rsquo;s mouth and he growled in pain and rage. A day later, he could not swallow anything for his mouth was all swollen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:right">(Adapted from <em>They Monke</em><em>y </em><em>and </em><em>the </em><em>Crocodile)</em></p>\r\n',created:"2016-09-28T12:18:39.035405Z",subject:3,exam:31},{id:78,name:"KCPE 2005 Passage 2 ENG",statement:"<p><em><u>Read the passage below and then answer questions 39 to 50.</u></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can you recall the last time you received a gift? How did you feel? We all love gifts and it is exciting to give or receive one. Gifts motivate us and remind us that there are still people who care about us. Parents, relatives and friends give us presents on important occasions. When we pass an examination, for example, <strong>those close to us</strong> may want to reward out efforts by showering us with gifts. Gifts strengthen relationships and encourage people to do well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gifts take many forms. Someone could offer to give you a ride to school or buy you lunch. Another may give you a watch, a goat or clothes. There have been cases of school boys and school girls being allowed to travel free of charge in buses and matatus. All these are examples of gifts and they may be given out of pure motives. However, some people often give gifts with evil intentions. Wicked people have used gifts to <strong>lure </strong>children whom they have then sexually abused or exploited in other ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Young people as well as adults can be deceived by those who pretend to be kind and generous. Such people may give expensive gifts intending to win the trust and friendship of those they are planning to exploit. Then, when they think they can get what they have been waiting for, they strike mercilessly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who easily become victims are the poor and the needy. Such people become very grateful when someone shows them concern and offers to provide what they need most. Feelings of gratitude may make a person do regrettable things. For example, if someone who has shown you great kindness asks you to do something which you know is wrong, you may find it very difficult to refuse. If a person pays your school fees and buys you clothes, you may find it impossible to resist his sexual advances. So when a person is too good to you, ask yourself what his or her motives are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A principal of a certain college began receiving a very generous visitor in his house. The visitor was very frequent and would come loaded with gifts. After some time, the principal&rsquo;s wife started becoming suspicious. Why does this person give us so many things, yet we don&rsquo;t know each other well? She asked herself. She suggested to her husband that every time the person brought them things, they should calculate their value and send somebody to pay for them the following day. The man had a shop near the college. He would take the money reluctantly. After three months, he came to the principal&rsquo;s house accompanied by his daughter. He wanted the daughter admitted but she did not qualify. The principal explained why he could not admit her. <strong>If he had accepted the &ldquo;gifts&rdquo;, ....</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be careful. Many people have got into trouble because they accepted gifts without considering who the giver was or what he or she wanted in return. If we are careful, we can save ourselves a lot of heartaches. If you are not sure why someone is giving you a present, reject it politely. You can also consult your parents or older brothers or sisters if you find it difficult to decide. Many people will want to tempt you to accept favors from them. Say &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Be contented with what you have. Many of those who go astray want to have things they cannot afford and when someone comes and promises to provide what they long for, they fall in to the trap.</p>\r\n",created:"2016-09-28T12:38:08.284375Z",subject:3,exam:31}],name:"English KCPE

Most foods can be made more attractive by adding a wide range of spices, which also stimulate the flow of digestive juices and consequently improve digestion. In many communities today, spices are used in much smaller quantities and are not considered as important as they were a hundred years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back then, most people did not have as wide a range of food as we have today. For this reason, large quantities of spices were essential to give variety to the monotonous salty flavor of food. In addition, spices were also used for medicinal purposes.

Odhiambo&nbsp;himself had no bicycle, but he could easily borrow one from a mechanic. This mechanic lived in one of the rental&nbsp;rooms owned by Odhiambo&rsquo;s father. During the day, he worked under a tree in front of the house. Many people&nbsp;brought their bicycles to him to be repaired. Sometimes they wanted the brakes mended or a punctured tube&nbsp;repaired. Whatever it was, the mechanic was equal to the job. If you passed by any time of the day, you would see&nbsp;him in the brown greasy work clothes putting life into a damaged bicycle. Usually, he turned the bicycle upside&nbsp;down&nbsp;with its wheels in the air while he worked on it. A signboard with his nickname, DOCTOR OF BICYCLES, was nailed to the tree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides the bicycles which came to him for repairs, the mechanic also had about five or six shillings of his&nbsp;own which he hired out for ten shillings an hour.&nbsp;It was one of these Odhiambo borrowed. He did not tell the mechanic that a learner was going to ride it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bicycle was meant for adults and too high for Maina but he made rapid progress. If he sat on the saddle his feet would not reach the pedals. So he adopted what was called the monkey-style; he rode standing on the pedals&nbsp;on one side of the triangular frame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After about one week of practice, Maina was able to ride long distances without falling off. He was even able&nbsp;to whistle a song as he rode along. Odhiambo was impressed with Maina&rsquo;s progress and suggested that it was time he&nbsp;tried riding on the main road instead of the playing field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maina was a bit doubtful at first but he agreed in the end to try one of the less busy roads. To his surprise, he&nbsp;did very well. He was so pleased that he began to whistle a popular tune and pedal to the beat. He felt very proud of&nbsp;himself and wondered why people said cycling was difficult. &lsquo;It was easier than eating &lsquo;&rsquo;ugali&rsquo;&rsquo;, he thought. Just then,&nbsp;a car came out of the side road and was heading towards him. He lost his nerve and swerved, hitting an electricity&nbsp;pole. He was thrown into a nearby drain out of which he emerged dripping dirty water. Although Maina was only slightly injured, the bicycle was badly damaged. The front wheel was twisted and three spokes also got broken. After fruitless repair efforts, Maina and&nbsp;Odhiambo decided to go and report to the mechanic. They had to roll the bicycle on the back wheel as they lifted&nbsp;the handlebars between them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mechanic was very angry. He said Maina had to pay for the damage. Maina pleaded with him saying he&nbsp;had no money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you have no money, who told you to ride my bicycle? Come and show me where you live. Your parents will&nbsp;pay for your foolishness. And if you don&rsquo;t hurry up, I will take you to the police station right now,&quot; the mechanic said&nbsp;when Maina appeared to hesitate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Maina led the way and the mechanic followed on one of his bicycles. Maina was afraid of taking the man&nbsp;to&nbsp;his uncle. So he decided to take him round and round the town. They went up one street, down the next and up the&nbsp;third.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Where do you live?&quot; asked the mechanic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t know the number,&quot; said Maina, &quot;but it is over there,&quot; and he pointed in front of him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a long time, they were back where they had started. The mechanic was so furious and was threatening&nbsp;to beat Maina. Blind with anger, he did not look where he was going and ran&nbsp;into a woman returning home from the&nbsp;market with her purchases. She immediately took off her head scarf and tied it firmly around her waist ready for a fight.&nbsp;She held the mechanic by his shirt and shouted at him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crowds were gathering. Some people were picking up the woman&rsquo;s things and putting them back into her&nbsp;basket. There were tomatoes, potatoes and some fish. But her voice rose higher and higher. She said she was not going home to prepare a meal from things picked off the road. She wanted two hundred shillings in compensation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the confusion, Maina melted away and ran home. In the evening, he reported to his uncle what he had&nbsp;done. His uncle was disappointed but he offered to pay for the repair of the damaged bicycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:right">(<em>Adapted from</em> <em>Chike and the River, by Chinua Achebe)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n',created:"2016-10-03T06:37:40.609046Z",subject:3,exam:33},{id:42,name:"KCPE 2007 Passage 2 eng",statement:"<p><em><u>Read the passage below and then answer the questions.</u></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way we relate with other people determines whether our lives will be happy or not. Therefore it is&nbsp;important to choose our friends carefully. If you have the wrong kind of friends, your life could be miserable, full of&nbsp;pain and disappointment.&nbsp;You need to associate with those who love and accept you just as you are. They are likely to&nbsp;bring joy into your life. People who possess the following qualities are the right ones to befriend.&nbsp;First of all, go for those who respect you. Those who allow you to be yourself, listen to you and care about&nbsp;your feelings. Such people do not do or say things that make you feel small or useless. You see, certain people are <em>so&nbsp;full of themselves</em> that they do not value anyone else&rsquo;s opinion. They think they are always right. They <strong>ridicule </strong>and&nbsp;belittle the contributions of others. Keep away from such characters. They are not good for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another characteristic to look for in a friend is trust. Relate with people you can rely on. Such people keep&nbsp;their promises. When you live with others at home, community or school, you soon discover that many of them keep&nbsp;letting you down. I have known people who pretend to be my friends, only to realize later that they were not sincere. They just wanted to use me for their own gain. They took advantage of our relationship. I have occasionally shared some personal information with friends and I have expected them to keep it secret.&nbsp;But the very following day, the story is on everybody&rsquo;s lips. At such times, i have felt so embarrassed that i have&nbsp;wished the earth would open up and swallow me. So a friend you can depend on is a gem, a rare treasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirdly, in a world where people are so rude and inconsiderate, you should look for people with good manners. Life is much more enjoyable when we are thoughtful and courteous towards each other. Saying &lsquo;thank you&rsquo;, &lsquo;sorry&rsquo; sounds very simple. However, these wonderful expressions do not exist in many people&rsquo;s vocabulary. Associate &nbsp;with people who show gratitude and who remember to apologise&nbsp;when they offend you. Avoid the bad- mannered because they will only cause you heartaches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is another quality that few people seem to possess. This is a sense of humour. Many of us take life too&nbsp;seriously and focus on the negative side of things. Do not be like that. Gather around you friends with whom you&nbsp;enjoy a hearty belly laugh, those who can even point out things about you that you can laugh at. Of course you&nbsp;should not laugh at others. No, no! That is unkind. But befriend people who help you to notice the funny side of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, do relate with people who share your interests. If you associate with people with whom you have&nbsp;nothing in common, you will soon get bored. Therefore, if you want to have an exciting time with people, pick those&nbsp;who identify with your goals and dreams. Yes, those who encourage you and help you <strong>realise</strong> the things you hope for.</p>\r\n",created:"2016-09-06T12:37:53.639524Z",subject:3,exam:33}],name:"English KCPE

Everyone in the car was quiet, thinking about the people who had sacrificed their lives so that Harry Thuku, the freedom fighter, could be set free.

Many young people get introduced to this habit through peer pressure, by aping their parents or the celebrities they watch on TV advertisements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, smokers give various reasons for maintaining this habit. They say cigarettes are useful stimulants and that they give the smokers something to do with their hands. Perhaps the most important cause for the increase in smoking is that it provides shared experience among the peer group and this continues even after it becomes a settled habit. At what point it actually becomes a habit difficult to shake off, is not possible to tell. The aggressive campaign through advertisements and advocacy by manufacturers has made things worse. Manufacturers argue that smoking provides employment through tobacco farming, manufacturing industries and contributes directly to the economy through payment of taxes. However, the government spends three times as much for the treatment of smoking-related ailments and on rehabilitation of smokers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The arguments against smoking are very valid. It can at times be very expensive for smokers and has no social advantage. The smoke from smokers is harmful and offensive to those around them (secondary smokers). It also interferes with teamwork since those who smoke keep excusing themselves to go and smoke. We know that tobacco stains the hands of smokers and makes the smokers have bad breath. In addition, it shortens one&#39;s breath, making it difficult for one to&nbsp;participate in activities which demand a lot of energy, such as athletics. But these are minor objections when we consider the damage it can do to one&#39;s health. There is enough evidence that smoking causes bronchitis and heart diseases, both of which can be fatal. It is, therefore, advisable for the young people to distance themselves from this habit if they want to live a healthy life.</p>\r\n",created:"2016-10-03T07:53:26.921038Z",subject:3,exam:34}],name:"English KCPE 2008",exam_type:"KCPE",number_of_questions:50,description:"",price:50,preview:!0,subject:3},{id:35,questions:[{exam:35,text_resource:21,topic:{id:380,title:"Comprehension passages",chapter:26},question_number:1,statement:"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",choices:{id:272,question:283,A:"<p>seeing</p>\r\n",B:"<p>viewing</p>\r\n",C:"<p>watching</p>\r\n",D:"<p>inspecting</p>\r\n",answer:"C",choices_image:[]},image_resources:[],grade:{id:3}},{exam:35,text_resource:21,topic:{id:380,title:"Comprehension passages",chapter:26},question_number:2,statement:"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",choices:{id:273,question:284,A:"<p>on</p>\r\n",B:"<p>over</p>\r\n",C:"<p>in</p>\r\n",D:"<p>about</p>\r\n",answer:"C",choices_image:[]},image_resources:[],grade:{id:3}},{exam:35,text_resource:21,topic:{id:380,title:"Comprehension passages",chapter:26},question_number:3,statement:"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",choices:{id:274,question:285,A:"<p>a</p>\r\n",B:"<p>the</p>\r\n",C:"<p>some</p>\r\n",D:"<p>that</p>\r\n",answer:"A",choices_image:[]},image_resources:[],grade:{id:3}},{exam:35,text_resource:21,topic:{id:380,title:"Comprehension passages",chapter:26},question_number:4,statement:"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",choices:{id:276,question:287,A:"<p>boundary</p>\r\n",B:"<p>line</p>\r\n",C:"<p>end</p>\r\n",D:"<p>edge</p>\r\n",answer:"D",choices_image:[]},image_resources:[],grade:{id:3}},{exam:35,text_resource:21,topic:{id:380,title:"Comprehension passages",chapter:26},question_number:5,statement:"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",choices:{id:278,question:289,A:"<p>Suddenly</p>\r\n",B:"<p>Just</p>\r\n",C:"<p>Immediately</p>\r\n",D:"<p>Now</p>\r\n",answer:"B",choices_image:[]},image_resources:[],grade:{id:3}},{exam:35,text_resource:21,topic:{id:380,title:"Comprehension passages",chapter:26},question_number:6,statement:"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",choices:{id:279,question:290,A:"<p>project</p>\r\n",B:"<p>task</p>\r\n",C:"<p>duty</p>\r\n",D:"<p>scheme</p>\r\n",answer:"B",choices_image:[]},image_resources:[],grade:{id:3}},{exam:35,text_resource:21,topic:{id:380,title:"Comprehension passages",chapter:26},question_number:7,statement:"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",choices:{id:280,question:291,A:"<p>watery</p>\r\n",B:"<p>wet</p>\r\n",C:"<p>sticky</p>\r\n",D:"<p>muddy</p>\r\n",answer:"B",choices_image:[]},image_resources:[],grade:{id:3}},{exam:35,text_resource:21,topic:{id:380,title:"Comprehension passages",chapter:26},question_number:8,statement:"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",choices:{id:281,question:292,A:"<p>Then</p>\r\n",B:"<p>Yet</p>\r\n",C:"<p>Moreover</p>\r\n",D:"<p>Instead</p>\r\n",answer:"D",choices_image:[]},image_resources:[],grade:{id:3}},{exam:35,text_resource:21,topic:{id:380,title:"Comprehension passages",chapter:26},question_number:9,statement:"<p>&nbsp;

Right then it was a kind of a secret and she loved secrets. Grover Middle School was her sixth new school in eight years .If you are as shy as she was, it was tough to be the new kid all the time. But it was not going to be tough anymore because she had read a book called <em>Instant ways to instant friends</em>. She was starting with lesson number one that day. It said &quot;Change your whole<strong> attitude.&nbsp;</strong>Think of yourself as somebody that everyone wants to know!&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was right and she was going to have fun and lots of it! Jennifer, aged twelve and half, had decided to break out of her old, shy nature at last.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her mother was driving her to school the first day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Scared?&rdquo; she asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No way,&rdquo; she answered, wondering if she had time to take her mirror out of her purse for one last peek at her hair. She was a little nervous but she wasn&rsquo;t going to admit that to her mum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That is the right spirit,&rdquo; her mother said. &ldquo;Remember, this may be a new school but <strong>you&rsquo;ve got a head start on the problem this time.&quot;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her mother wasn&rsquo;t thinking about Jennifer&rsquo;s solemn vow and her book on making friends. Those were secrets and there was no way Jennifer was going to tell her mother, they were too personal and who tells secrets to their mothers, anyway?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I know. I know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is the school where you were a <em>pom pom </em>girl and Dad was in the Maths club, and you fell in love in the eighth class.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget your dad was the chairman of the Maths club,&rdquo; her mother said with a laugh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jennifer loved to listen to her mum&rsquo;s bubbly laugh .In fact, she decided to imitate it as part of the new her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;My mum, the <em>pom-pom</em> queen,&rdquo; Jennifer said, imitating her mum&rsquo;s laugh. She wondered if it sounded okay or if it sounded fake. She decided she would have to work on it. &ldquo;Do you think there is anyone in the school who still remembers you and Dad?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t make it sound like we went to school in the Dark Ages! We&rsquo;re not that old.&rdquo; Jennifer&rsquo;s mother stopped in front of the school to let her out. Then she said. &ldquo;Blow them away with the Bell family charm,honey.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No problem, mum&rdquo; Jennifer answered. When she opened the door, a rush of cold air hit her. She then realized that she definitely needed a heavier jacket. The Octobers here were a lot colder than in California where they had just moved from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I like your change of attitude, Jennifer.&rdquo; Jennifer&rsquo;s mother said as she leaned over to look at her through the car window. &quot;What brought it on?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Instant maturity, I guess,&rdquo; she said with a grin. &quot;Thanks for the ride mum. See you later.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Do you want me to pick you up after school?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No thanks,&rdquo; she said. &quot;I&rsquo;ll walk home.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her mum drove off and Jennifer turned to start her new life as the new her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:right"><strong>(Adapted from Can you keep a secret by Elizabeth van Steanwyk</strong>)</p>\r\n</div>\r\n',created:"2016-10-03T08:59:14.521746Z",subject:3,exam:35},{id:23,name:"KCPE 2009 Passage 2 eng",statement:"<p><em><u>Read the passage below and then answer questions</u></em><u> <strong>39</strong> <em>to</em> <strong>50</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Why do we go to school? Why do we strive to get an education? Well, perhaps you will say that we spend so much time and resources in the classroom so as to acquire skills for which society will be willing to pay. This will enable us to earn a living and eventually improve our standard of living. While it is definitely true that education arms us with necessary tools to be able to <strong>put bread on our tables</strong>, there are more benefits that come from education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Education makes you a better person in many ways. It broadens your understanding of various issues that are likely to affect your life .These include health ,economic ,social and political matters .An educated person is able to independently access information on how to live a healthier life. Similarly, the educated person is empowered to make <strong>sound</strong> economic and political decisions based on ideas obtained through different channels of information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your thinking abilities are also sharpened through education. With the rapid development of technology, today it is easier to get information. There is always so much information that it is often difficult to distinguish between the true and the false; the important and the trivial; the relevant and the irrelevant. An educated mind is, however, able to critically examine the information and to decide what to make of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Society too reaps benefits when its individuals are educated. Where would society be without doctors, teachers, engineers, drivers or lawyers? People in different occupations have their roles to play in making society a better place to live. Indeed, many inventions that have improved&nbsp; society have sprung&nbsp; from minds of educated individuals .A truly educated person is always thinking of how to make society better by introducing more effective and efficient ways of doing things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;What of peace and harmony? When we get educated, we learn about other people and their cultures. This makes us understand and accept them as part of our society. In this way, unnecessary conflict is avoided and we become willing to join hands with others in order to achieve certain goals for the good of us all. Evidently, there is so much to be gained from education .It is therefore not surprising that governments and households put aside <strong>substantial </strong>amounts of their income to spend on books and other support materials, teachers and development of educational facilities.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",created:"2016-08-05T09:02:16.591867Z",subject:3,exam:35}],name:"English KCPE

They were out walking together and had stopped, as they often did to admire a handsome brick house. With its lovely windows and neat lawn, it seemed as grand as a palace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then John Dickens told his son that if he worked very hard, someday he might live in that house. The thought took Charles&rsquo; breath away. The sort of person who would live in that house would be a distinguished man of taste and education. His father believed that Charles would someday be like that. All he had to do was to work hard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He could not have known that day how far he would fall or how high he would rise, and that he would really live in that house, and that he would die there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Charles looked back in his childhood, these were happy years. They lived in a small house which had a little garden and, across the road there was a play ground for the children. He had a nursemaid; Mary who comforted his childish sorrows. She also terrified him with blood-curdling horror stories that he adored, though they gave him nightmares. He spent wonderful time in his tiny room reading from his father&rsquo;s set of novels. He went for days imagining himself to be one of his storybook heroes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when Charles was ten, his father was transferred to London and his happy childhood came to a sudden stop. His father had many wonderful qualities. He worked hard in his job and he was loving to his wife and children. He had many friends and loved to invite them to the house in the evening for a bowl of steaming porridge and lively conversations. But he had one terrible fault: he spent more money that he made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the ten years of Charles&rsquo; life, the family had lived in six different houses, each poorer than the one before. And as the number of mouths to feed kept growing, the family fell deeper and deeper into debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When they reached London, Charles was shocked to learn that he would not be sent to school, they couldn&rsquo;t afford it. He stayed at home and made himself useful by cleaning his father&rsquo;s boots and minding the younger siblings. His parents seemed to have forgotten him and all his ambition</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two days after his twelfth birthday, Charles was sent to work at a factory. From eight in the morning, till eight at night, he worked in a dark room, covering pots of boot polish and pasting on labels. Other children worked there too, but they were not like his old friends. They were poor boys with rough manners who referred to him scornfully as the &ldquo;young gentleman&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Worse still, two weeks later his father was arrested for debt and sent to prison, where he had to stay until his debts were cleared. His wife and children were allowed to join him there, the whole family living in one room - everyone except Charles. The factory was too far from the prison for him to get back before the gates were shut at night. So he lived in a cheap boarding house. From Monday morning to Saturday night he was on his own with &ldquo;no advice, no counsel, no encouragement, no consolation, no support from anyone.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At night he wandered through the dark city. His clothes were shabby. He had no friends. Instead of growing into a fine gentleman, he had descended into the streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The memory of that time was so painful that, even as a grown man, Charles could not walk through those streets without the sting of tears coming to his eyes. And years later, when he became a famous writer, his stories were filled with orphaned and abandoned children, debtor&rsquo;s prisons, factories, and the grim and degrading lives of the poor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>(Adapted from Charles dickens, the man who had Great Expectations by Diane Stanley and Peter Vennema.

When we feel lazy, we do not want to do any work. We want to let things stay as they are. Well, at times we all enjoy being a little lazy such as on a very hot or cold day. However, if this occurs too often we, need to do something about it. This is not to say that we should always be working so as not to be thought as lazy. We need to rest and refresh our bodies and minds after working for long hours. For us to do our work efficiently and eventually have a&nbsp;successful life, we must learn how to overcome laziness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can this monster be overcome? If you feel you have a lot to do, you will probably feel overwhelmed and let laziness overcome you instead of you overcoming laziness. The solution is to break down the huge task into small manageable parts which makes you feel you do not require too much effort. In such cases, the cause of laziness is lack of motivation. This means you simply do not see the reason for carrying out a task. In such cases, it is important to think about or visualize the importance of performing your task and achieving your goals. Think about the benefits you will reap if you overcome laziness and take action instead of thinking about difficulties or obstacles. Your imagination has a great influence on your mind, habits, and actions. When tempted to be lazy imagine yourself performing the task easily and energetically. Do this before starting a task or when your mind tells you to abandon what you are doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes laziness leads to procrastination. This is the act of postponing tasks without good reasons. If there is something you have to do now, and you actually do it, why not just do it and get it over with? An old saying goes, &#39;Do not put off until tomorrow what you can do today.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, you need to realize that overcoming laziness is achieved through a series of daily actions and activities. Every time you overcome laziness, you get stronger, more able to achieve your goals and improve your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Adapted from Tips to overcome laziness by Remez Sasson.

It is therefore not <strong>__7__</strong> that some people have demanded the complete elimination of <strong>__8__&nbsp;</strong>species from the face of the earth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is interesting to note that the insect does not<strong>&nbsp;__9__&nbsp;</strong>to spread disease. It just wants to feed itself and to reproduce. Researchers have discovered that the female mosquito needs to feed on blood in order to lay eggs. As it moves from one source to another in <strong>__10__&nbsp;</strong>of blood, it ends up picking up and spreading the organisms that cause the disease. A common rule of nature is <strong>__11__</strong> at work here: the survival of one creature means death of another.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some scientists have argued that the insect is not&nbsp;<strong>__12__ </strong>useless. It serves as food for some other creatures such as lizards, geckos and birds. The lives of these predators&nbsp;<strong>__13__</strong> be at risk if there were no mosquitoes, and this would <strong>__14__</strong> affect the population of animals that in turn feed on the predators. All this would finally affect the food chain, causing an imbalance <strong>__15__</strong> nature.</p>\r\n",created:"2016-09-16T11:33:29.357448Z",subject:3,exam:37},{id:10,name:"KCPE 2011 Passage 1 eng",statement:"<p><em><u>Read the passage below and then answer questions <strong>26</strong> to <strong>38</strong>.</u></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I wonder what Aoko is doing at home,&rdquo; Njeri said, looking at her friend Cherono. &ldquo; Why don&rsquo;t we go and find out?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three were close friends, in fact inseparable. They spent most of the day together, especially during the school holidays like now. Nine o&rsquo;clock always found the girls together, and they would not part till evening. Strangely today, Aoko was nowhere to be seen yet it was already ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two girls walked to Aoko&rsquo;s home. As they neared the house, Njeri called out, &ldquo;Aoko, you have visitors!&rdquo; There was no response. Obviously their friend was not in.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside the house was seated an old lady the two girls had never seen before. They went up to her and Cherono greeted her in Aoko&rsquo;s mother tongue. Cherono spoke the language fluently, one could not tell she was from another community. The old lady responded and smiled broadly, exposing toothless gums. Njeri guessed the old lady was probably a hundred years old. Cherono then asked her where Aoko was.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I sent her to the shops to buy something, just get in and wait. I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s on her way back,&rdquo; said the lady. Njeri did not understand a word. She just followed her friend into the house. Half an hour later, the girls were still waiting. Impatience got the better of Njeri. She suggested that they go away and return later. Cherono on the other hand, had a different idea. She was curious about the old lady seated outside.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we go out and chat with the old lady, you know these old people usually have fascinating stories to tell,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t understand a thing. For you, the language is not the problem, so you&rsquo;ll probably enjoy the stories,&rdquo; grumbled Njeri.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a little persuasion, Njeri gave in on condition that Cherono would translate everything into English or Kiswahili. They went out and found the old lady humming a tune. She was in a world of her own, her face a picture of happiness. She did not seem to notice the two girls, who also did not want to break in on her bliss.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed when she realized she was being watched. &ldquo;I really love singing. It is good for the soul. Do you also sing?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Njeri looked at Cherono expecting her to translate what the old lady had just said. And she did. &ldquo;I see your friend does not understand our language. The lady commented in English. The two girls were taken aback. &ldquo;They just wanted to find out whether you two also love to sing,&rdquo; she said looking at Njeri.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Njeri, &ldquo;but I did not know you spoke English.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lady let out a hearty laugh, once again exposing her toothless gums. She then went on to explain that she was a retired teacher of English, having taught for forty years.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was taught English by its owners,&rdquo; she boasted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Just as I learnt your language by its owners,&rdquo; Cherono remarked proudly. It was the lady&rsquo;s turn to be astonished. &ldquo;You mean you do not come from our community yet you speak our language so well?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aoko arrived to find the three deep in conversation. She was holding a newspaper. She explained that she had to walk all the way to the shopping centre for it,&nbsp;&ldquo;My grandmother loves reading and as soon as she arrived here this morning she asked for a newspaper.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon afterwards the three girls skipped happily away leaving the old lady buried in the&nbsp;paper.</p>\r\n",created:"2016-10-06T19:01:05.730432Z",subject:3,exam:37},{id:11,name:"KCPE 2011 Passage 2 eng",statement:'<p><em><u>Read the passage below and then answer questions <strong>39</strong> to<strong> 50</strong></u></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most amazing things about the discovery of a 2,000-year-old cemetery in the Bahariyah Oasis in Egypt was that no one was looking for it. No one even knew it existed. It had been completely hidden by sand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1996, a donkey belonging to a guard at the nearby temple stumbled into a hole in the sand a mile from the temple. When the guard peered into the hole, he saw something shining brightly. He reported the discovery to the Egyptian archeologists right away.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;However, the archeologists did not begin a serious digging immediately. They did not have the workers or the money. So they made a quick survey of the site, and then covered up everything again. They wanted to hide it from thieves and protect it from exposure to the sun and the weather. Finally, in 1999, they had enough money to begin exploring the site.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;On their first day of work, after digging only several feet into the sand, they found a lot of mummies. Mummies are dead bodies that have been preserved for a long time. They are mostly found in Egypt. One of them had an especially beautiful mask. It was not a pharaoh&rsquo;s mummy, though. It turned out that one of the tombs in this cemetery belonged to royalty. Most of the people buried here came from the families that grew rich wine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most spectacular of these mummies have masks made out of plaster covered with a thin layer of gold. Many are in wonderful condition. And because grave robbers never found these tombs, everything that was buried with them is still there. Most of the mummies have been left where they were found, but a few of the best-preserved ones are on display at the Bahariyah Museum, where the public can take a look at them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two mummies were found lying side by side and were probably husband and wife. His chest plate and mask were decorated with religious figures. Her head was turned in his direction, indicating that the husband died first.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other two mummies are of children. Archeologists think they were brother and sister because they were found together. The boy was probably five years old. His mask with its painted eyes and features are so real &ndash; he almost seems alive!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did the archeologists find treasures in these tombs? It depends on&nbsp;what you mean by &ldquo;treasures&rdquo;. They have not found any solid gold, but they have discovered all sorts of objects. The people buried in the cemetery may have thought some of these items would be useful in the afterlife. Or some may have been intended as gifts to the gods. For example, archeologists have unearthed small statues of various gods, they have found many pieces of jewelry-necklaces, bracelets, and anklets- made of copper, glass, ivory and semi-precious stones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They have also discovered many pottery pieces used for storing, cooking or preserving food. There were some bronze Greek and Roman coins too. And in the children&rsquo;s tombs, they found toys-carved animals for their children to play within the afterlife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Archeologists will be able to learn more about these people and their way of life by further studying the mummies and the things buried with them. And so many mummies were buried in the Valley of the Golden Mummies and excavation and learning of the site will continue years to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align: right;">(<em>Adapted from <strong>Secrets of the Past</strong> by World Book, Inc. 2002)</em></p>\r\n',created:"2016-09-07T13:07:26.612935Z",subject:3,exam:37}],name:"English KCPE 2011",exam_type:"KCPE",number_of_questions:50,description:"",price:50,preview:!0,subject:3},{id:38,questions:[{exam:38,text_resource:15,topic:{id:378,title:"Comprehension;

She had the most loving parents. Her parents were immensely rich. She lacked for nothing. Her favourite time was bedtime when her parents would tell her wonderful inspiring stories. However, all this was shattered one afternoon when her mother died suddenly of unknown illness. Stasha and her father were heartbroken. He suddenly looked old. Deciding to devote himself to Stasha, he swore never to remarry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t long, however, before it became clear that he couldn&rsquo;t manage to bring his daughter up on his own. He therefore remarried and got two other daughters. If Stasha had hoped to gain another loving mother and siblings to share things and play with, she was badly mistaken. Her stepmother turned her into a servant-one could even say a slave. She was expected to do all the household chores and the farm work as well. Heavy beating awaited her if she failed to finish the work. She always looked dirty, overworked, weak and <strong>famished</strong> for she never had enough to eat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One day when Stasha s father was travelling to another&nbsp;country, he asked his three daughters what they would like him to bring to each of them. The stepsisters asked for expensive shoes, clothes and jewellery. Stasha on the other hand, paused for a long time and then requested, &ldquo;Please bring me the most beautiful plant that you can find.&rdquo; And for once in a long time, her father did not fail her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plant was truly beautiful. She planted it on her mother&rsquo;s grave and watered it faithfully. As to respond to her tender loving care, it blossomed and produced the most beautiful flowers ever seen. It attracted colorful birds and insects. One particular bird, called Chapchap, became Stasha&rsquo;s best friend and advisor. Whenever the&nbsp;stepmother and sisters&nbsp;tried to uproot the plant, Chapchap ordered the insects to attack them viciously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Days turned into years, and then one day, the son of the king declared that he wanted&nbsp;to marry. He ordered that all the beautiful young girls of the land attend a three-day party at the palace. It was from among them that he would choose his bride. Each girl adorned herself in her best clothes and jewellery. Poor Stasha had no such but her friend, Chapchap, came in handy. He not only gave her very beautiful clothes and shoes but also helped her finish her chores in good time. At the palace, the prince was simply enchanted with her beauty. On the second day, Chapchap gave her gold bracelets for her small shapely wrists. The prince could hardly take his eyes off her. He danced with her all evening. Stasha&rsquo;s stepsisters were green with envy and wondered which heaven this rival had dropped from. They were relieved when she left early but the prince was very disappointed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the final day of the party, Stasha lost one bracelet as the prince tried to stop her from escaping early yet again. The following day, the prince swore that his bride would be the girl that the discarded bracelet would fit. He went from home to home looking for the girl. When he eventually came to Stashas home, her stepsisters found a golden opportunity to try their luck. The elder one tried to cut her thumb so that the bracelet could fit her but Chapchap alerted the Prince. The younger one, whose hand was too small had herself stung by a bee in the wrist, but once again, Chapchap&nbsp;<strong>blew the whistle on her</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapchap then advised the Prince to try the bracelet on the dirt-covered girl in the garden. It fitted her perfectly. The Prince immediately ordered that plans for the wedding commence. Even more colorful was the wedding that followed a few days later. Stasha, against the advice of Chapchap, had invited even her stepmother and stepsisters.</p>\r\n",created:"2016-09-08T08:54:07.487473Z",subject:3,exam:38},{id:17,name:"KCPE 2012 PASSAGE 2 ENG",statement:"<p><em><u>Read the passage below and then answer the questions.</u></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pupils of Kimbuni Primary School and the neighbouring community have realized that it is possible to grow a forest even in a dry area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ten years ago, Mr.Kumbi was posted to the school to teach science. The head teacher said that the new teacher was very keen on tree planting and farming. &ldquo;He will be in charge of the afforestation campaign and he will help us to establish a school farm,&rdquo; the headteacher declared. The pupils stared at the headteacher and Mr.Kumbi in disbelief. What kind of farming could happen in this place which received rain only in November and remained dry and dusty for the rest of the year?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The headteacher was a local resident and he knew what Mr. Kumbi was proposing was not going to be easy. But he promised to co-operate. Mr. Kumbi had received agricultural training in college. He was so enthusiastic and confident that the headteacher admired him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Mr. Kumbi is the proud patron of the Environmental Club, the Young Farmers Association and the Green Belt movement in the school. He has inspired such love for growing trees that each pupil in the school has planted at least two trees and is taking care of them. The species include the <strong>exotic</strong> and indigenous ones. The pupils believe that the greenery of the whole compound which has even spread to the surrounding village is entirely the work of Mr.Kumbi. However, Mr.Kumbi emphasizes that it is the efforts of the pupils. At no stage does he give himself the credit that is so obviously his.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pupils remember the trips Mr.Kumbi used to make in his pick-up truck to get red soil and seedlings.They remember going to collect cow dung from the fields and their own homes. Fetching water from the stream was very tiring. Later, the headteacher and the parents organized a fundraising event and the school was able to buy a water pump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The water pump has enabled the school not only to water the trees but also to grow food crops. Nowadays, pupils of Kimbuni Primary School can boast of a good meal at lunchtime and a quiet retreat into the forest they have helped to grow. The school is a big contrast to what it used to be ten years ago when parents had to buy every food item on the menu, draw water and meet the cost of replacing corrugated sheets blown off by the wind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kimbuni primary school is now a model school. It is surrounded by trees and there are lovely plots of potatoes, cabbages, beans, cauliflower and kales. There are also banana groves and small plantations of maize and millet. The school also keeps dairy cows, pigs and poultry. The boys and girls no longer look for manure for they have more than enough. The school is a living example of what determination can do.</p>\r\n",created:"2016-09-08T09:00:30.823381Z",subject:3,exam:38}],name:"English KCPE

From the doorway, she could look across the empty stretches of the uncultivated land. It was worse when the darkness covered everywhere making it hard for her not to feel afraid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was fourteen when she lost her rough, good &ndash; for &ndash; nothing father. He had lost his way on a stormy night and was found dead in the morning. Her mother had died when she was very young. She had been left alone, in <strong>&nbsp;possession </strong>&nbsp;of a dog, some chickens and a spinning-wheel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mary was a bright, cheerful and courageous child and within a short time, she had become famous for her spinning techniques. Any rough wool brought to her was spun into thread for knitting. Her hens also were productive enough and this made her a popular egg seller, and her dog just like any other, provided adequate protection and company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mary was illiterate but she never forgot a prayer her mother had taught her: &rdquo;God bless this house from thatch to floor, the saints guard the door, and four good angels&nbsp;watch my bed, two at the foot and two at the head.&rdquo;&nbsp;She&rsquo;d kneel and recite the verse every night before going to bed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Mary was a loner, she was happy and contented with her business. And yet people who happened to pass by her little hut late at night begun to whisper strange stories. The village talk reached the religious leader who decided to come and question the girl. Mary wept bitterly on realizing that these stories were being told about her. She explained to the religious leader everything she did but he seemed not to have been convinced. He decided to investigate why the villagers were spreading those rumors about her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, late that night, without a word to anyone, the religious leader lit his lantern and went out. The village was still and dark with stars shining here and there in the dark sky. His lantern swung from side to side as he walked slowly up the road towards the bushes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At last, he saw the hut half- hidden among the bushes. He stopped suddenly when a light streamed through a narrow chink in the wall. He covered his own lantern with his clock and went forward very quickly and carefully. Although it was pitch dark, the <strong>faint glimmer of stars </strong>&nbsp;made it possible for him to see several men standing close to the walls of the hut whispering to one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The religious leader guessed who they were, fell upon his knees but the strangers melted away into the darkness as if they had been pictures in a dream. He rose from his knees and moved towards the window to peep into the hut. Instantly, an invisible hand threw a gleaming sword in front of him and a low voice spoke to him a solemn warning: &ldquo;Do not look. It is the light of angles.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He put his hand upon the sword and prayed. The sword moved slowly away and vanished. He leaned forward and gazed through the chink. With a cry of happiness, he saw a corner of Mary&rsquo;s wooden bed and in the corner a great golden wing. Then there was darkness. He thought that darkness had fallen upon him because of the glorious thing that he had seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Praising God for all his goodness, he returned home. He woke up the next day, went to Mary&rsquo;s hut and apologized on behalf of the villagers. To this day, the villagers still talk about May and how her simple prayer was answered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:right"><em>( adapted from Oxford English Course, &nbsp;F. G.

People had to travel long distances to convey messages. Roads were quite impassable and there were no reliable means of transport. It took a long time for one to travel from one part of the country to another. Whenever one heard the beating of a drum or saw smoke, they would tell there was need for them to gather.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travelling from Nairobi to Kisumu would take a number of days. Imagine that you were admitted to a school of your choice but all vehicles went on strike on opening day and yet you had only that day or you would be replaced, or that someone fell sick and needed to see a doctor!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Owing to this many other reasons, a group of companies came up with an interesting idea. With the increased movement of people, there was&nbsp;need to connect people to the existing telephone networks in the better ways. They <strong>scrutinized </strong>&nbsp;the existing telephone networks and developed a small handset or mobile phone that offers nearly everything you need. This has proved to be very useful to many people. However, in order to avoid offending others, we need to keep the following suggestions in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fist of all, unless your call is urgent, make it at a time that is convenient for the other person. In most cases avoid making calls early in the morning, late at night, or at meal times. It is quite expensive using a telephone ; therefore, it is necessary to avoid irrelevant information such as, &ldquo; it is now raining heavily, our cow has calved or my aunt has a new hairstyle.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check the number you are calling and be sure to touch or dial carefully. If you do not recognize the voice that answers the phone, give the number you are calling and ask if you have reached it. If you have made a mistake, apologize for the inconvenience caused. Allow time for someone to answer the phone, probably let the phone ring at least six to ten times. This gives the receiver about eighteen seconds to reach the phone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When someone answers, identify yourself and state your purpose, as many people become anxious when a caller does not give his or her name. Speak clearly, pronounce words carefully and vary your pitch and loudness, as it is difficult to distinguish between some sounds on the phone than is in person. Avoid monopolizing the phone as this may inconvenience the person you are talking to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as there are procedures to follow when making a&nbsp;<strong>social call</strong>, so are there when receiving it. Answer appropriately by saying &ldquo;hallo&rdquo; and wait for the caller to speak. If the caller is unknown, be cautious about disclosing personal information.You might ask, &ldquo;who is speaking, please?&rdquo; or &ldquo;what number are you calling?&rdquo; Respond to the situation. If the person whom the caller wishes to speak to is not available, offer to take the message. Record it and post it where it can be seen. If a person seems confused&nbsp;or demands your name or number ask,&rdquo;what number are you dialling?&rdquo; if misdialled, say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, you&rsquo;ve reached the wrong number.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally be honest but courteous. If you are short of time or are expecting another call, tell your caller. To avoid being rude,you might provide a brief explanation such as, &ldquo;Juma, I have sat down to eat dinner, can I call you back in an hour?&rdquo; or Mary, I have enjoyed talking to you but I need to go now. My brother wants to use the phone to get some information about an assignment.&rdquo;with this information, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll enjoy using your phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>( Adapted From Special

In fact, I hardly recall any occasion as a child when I was alone. In my community, the sons and daughters of one&rsquo;s aunts and uncles are considered brothers and sisters, not cousins. We have no half-brothers and half-sisters. My mother&rsquo;s sister is my mother, my uncle&rsquo;s son is my brother and my brother&rsquo;s child is my son or my daughter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Of my mother&rsquo;s three huts, one was used for cooking, one for sleeping and one for storage. In the hut in which we slept, there was no furniture. We slept on mats and sat on the bare ﬂoor. I did not discover pillows until much later. My mother cooked food in a three-legged iron pot over an open ﬁre at the center of the hut or outside. We grew all the food we ate at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">From an early age, I spent most of my free time in the ﬁeld playing and ﬁghting with the other boys of the village. A boy who remained at home tied to his mother&rsquo;s apron strings was regarded as a weakling. At night, I shared my food and blanket with these same boys. I was no more than ﬁve when I became a herdsboy looking after sheep and calves in the ﬁelds. I discovered the almost mystical attachment that the Xhosa have for cattle, not only as a source of food and wealth, but as a blessing from God and a source of happiness. It was in the ﬁelds that l leamt how to knock birds out of the sky with a slingshot, to gather wild honey and fruits and edible roots, to drink warm, sweet milk straight from the udder of a cow, to swim in the clear streams, and to catch ﬁsh with twine and sharpened bits of wire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">As boys, <strong>we were mostly left to our own devices</strong>. We played with toys we made ourselves. We moulded animals and birds out of clay. Nature was our playground. I learnt to ride by sitting atop weaned calves &mdash; after being thrown to the ground several times, one got the hang of it. I still love open spaces, the simple beauties of nature, the clear blue skies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">I don&rsquo;t think my parents intended to take me to school. No one in my family had ever attended school. But a friend of my father&rsquo;s, George Mbekela, visited us one day and told my mother, &ldquo;Your son is a clever young fellow. He should go to school.&rdquo; My parents discussed it and decided to send me to school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">The school consisted of a simple room. I was seven years old, and on the day before I was to begin, my father took me aside and told me that l must be dressed properly for school. Until that time, I, like all the other boys, had worn&nbsp;only a blanket, which was wrapped round one shoulder and pinned at the waist. My father took a pair of his trousers and cut them at the knee. He then told me to put them on, which I did, and they were roughly the correct length, although the waist was far too large. My father then took a piece of string and drew the trousers in at the waist. l must have been a comical sight, but I have never owned a suit l was prouder to wear than my father&rsquo;s cut-off trousers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: right;">(Adapted from Long Walk to Freedom by Nelson Mandela)</p>\r\n',created:"2016-10-27T08:12:48.874227Z",subject:3,exam:40},{id:103,name:"KCPE 2014 Passage 2 Eng",statement:'<p dir="ltr"><u><em>Read the following passage and then answer questions 39 to 50.</em></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Patriotism has been a very common word since independence. Recently, the slogan &ldquo;I am proud to be a Kenyan&rdquo; was introduced to us in an effort to make us appreciate being Kenyans. However, many of us have never seriously thought about what it means to be proud as Kenyans. A lot of our mannerisms, interests and values, some of which we are ready to defend with our own lives, have nothing to do with Kenya. In fact, it is as if we hate ourselves; and if we do, who will love us?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Some of us have an <strong>obsession</strong> for things from other countries, especially Western countries. We proudly wear attire and shoes, even underwear, from foreign countries. <strong>We love showing them off.</strong> This also applies to utensils and electronics since we look at the label &lsquo;MADE IN ............... ..&rsquo; even before we know the price. The slogan &lsquo;Buy Kenya, Build Kenya&rsquo; has been disregarded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">This has led to our supermarkets, main shops and markets being stocked with products and goods from foreign countries. In fact, it is not surprising to ﬁnd items that are easily available locally having been imported and well displayed in the shops or markets. Such products include toys, spices, fruits, vegetables and even eggs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">We have made our country a dumping ground for things, some of which are no longer useful in their countries of origin. This has denied our local industries a market for their products. As a result, they have been forced to <strong>cut down on</strong> the number of their employees in order to remain in operation. This has worsened the problem of unemployment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Consider the ridiculous preference seen in sports, especially soccer. It is very surprising that some soccer fans do not know the name of the coach of our national team yet they know all the players in a foreign team. During the last World Cup competition, some people found it hard to support the African teams. One wonders what drives us to support foreign teams when their own countries are solidly behind them. When these teams lose, their countries are disappointed but they do not transfer their loyalty to teams from other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">For some of us, the attachment to foreign teams is so much that when the teams lose, we cry, break our television sets, ﬁght and, in extreme cases, commit suicide. Patriotism demands that we see the failure of our teams as our country&rsquo;s failure. Likewise, success is celebrated by all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">We have to love our own and value ourselves in order to be attractive, respectable and valuable to the outside world. We therefore need not use other people&rsquo;s items to feel fashionable, stylish and desirable.</p>\r\n',created:"2016-10-27T08:28:43.566688Z",subject:3,exam:40}],name:"English KCPE

There was an electric fence separating the park from people&rsquo;s homes. Kalulu and the other children knew some animals could be dangerous but they were not afraid. The fence and the game wardens stopped the animals from attacking them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kalulu loved watching the animals as they grazed near the fence. He even composed a poem about some of the animals that he saw day after day:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love you Giraffe because</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are so tall and graceful</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You eat the freshest of leaves</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And you don&rsquo;t bother anyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You don&rsquo;t look like any other creature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, Giraffe, will l grow tall like you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pity you little Dik Dik because</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are so tiny and helpless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You keep your distance</strong> and are so fearful,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I&rsquo;m so happy when you pass by.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If l could hold you in my arms,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Would you allow me to stroke you, gently?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to think of you, Warthog;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are small and not so good-looking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But you don&rsquo;t make me feel frightened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You run around and l don&rsquo;t know why and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You speak a language l don&rsquo;t understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, Warthog, why don&rsquo;t you ever look at me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he was not in school, Kalulu would stand near the fence and admire the animals as they grazed or passed by. He kept a safe distance because he had been warned never to go too near the fence. It was dangerous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One day, he saw a man walking towards him. Kalulu thought the man was too near the fence. When he got closer, he realized it was Juma, a neighbour he liked very much. Whenever he found children in a group, Juma would tell them stories and sing for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Juma was now very close; Kalulu noticed that he was not walking straight. &ldquo;Perhaps he has come from the local bar,&rdquo; Kalulu said to himself. He watched him keenly, wondering why he was walking so close to the fence. Kalulu wanted to warn him but before he could do so, Juma staggered. What happened next made Kalulu <strong>tremble with fear</strong>. He saw Juma ﬂy in the air before he fell to the ground with a thud. He groaned once then went still. Kalulu began crying and shouting for help at the same time. Juma must have touched the wires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kalulu could not move from where he stood. It was as if he had been planted on the spot. People heard the shouting and came running. No one dared touch Juma. They merely stood there and stared. Then his daughter who was about ten years old pushed her way through the crowd and fell on her father, sobbing and calling him. Her voice worked like magic. He stirred a little, then opened his eyes. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive!&ldquo; someone shouted excitedly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That fence is dangerous!&rdquo; another added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crowd that had been so silent grew noisy. Everybody was mumbling something. &ldquo;Dad, let&rsquo;s go home,&quot; said the little girl. &ldquo;Leave these people alone. None of them was willing to help you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With his daughter&rsquo;s help, Juma tried to stand up. The crowd cheered. &ldquo;They say <strong>a cat has nine lives</strong> someone commented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:right">(Adapted from Kalulu and the Animals by C.M .

Since people are getting busier and busier, they have little time to build relationships with one another. In the past, most people lived close to their families and relatives. This made interaction easy because everyone knew everyone else in the neighbourhood. In addition, there were many communal activities. It is not like that any longer, especially in the urban areas. Some people do not know those who live next to them. Each minds his or her own business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, a man called Bonuke died in his house but his neighbours only began to suspect that something had gone wrong when his decomposing body began to smell. That was two weeks after he had passed on. One wonders: didn&rsquo;t anyone miss him? Didn&lsquo;t he have relatives or friends or workmates?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loneliness is real and it makes people feel unwanted and miserable. <strong>Yet we continue to build walls instead of bridges between us.</strong> Nowadays, some of us use newspapers or radio to look for friends. Notices like the one below are common:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A young, beautiful, honest and ﬁnancially stable lady is lonely, so</p>\r\n\r\n<p>lonely. If you are a single gentleman, rich and handsome and not</p>\r\n\r\n<p>more than thirty-ﬁve years old, please contact me. I promise to</p>\r\n\r\n<p>make you happy. Together we will build a little heaven here on earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A message like this shows that people are so desperate for friendship that they will even try to connect with strangers. But one must be very careful. <strong>Wicked</strong> people can and do take advantage of innocent people. Friendship should develop naturally as we relate with others in school, in the neighbourhood or at the place of work. We all need friends and it is not a weakness to admit it. Life is much more exciting when we are surrounded by people who care about us and accept us just the way we are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we want to get along with others, there are things we need to do. First of all, we must recognise that every person is important. We should treat everyone with respect. Respect means that we value others and listen to them without judging them. We also demonstrate respect for others by the way we talk about them when they are not around. Nothing destroys relationships faster than gossip. Instead of listening to and spreading rumours, we should protect the reputation of others. Let&rsquo;s treat others the way we would want to be treated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, we should be gentle and patient with one another. No one is perfect. So, when our friends or relatives make mistakes and disappoint us, we should remember that we, too, have weaknesses and often let others down. Whenever we are wronged, we should be willing to forgive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, we ought to support one another at all times. We should celebrate the achievements of others and also share in their sorrows. People who are mean and selﬁsh are rarely happy. True happiness is experienced when people help one another. Getting along well with others is the solution to loneliness.</p>\r\n",created:"2016-10-27T09:11:11.788891Z",subject:3,exam:41}],name:"English KCPE

Licha ya kufanyishwa kazi za sulubu kutwa kucha, alicharazwa kwa mijeledi. Mtumwa huyu jina Hashimu hakuweza kustahimili tena mateso haya. Alipiga moyo konde, akaamua kutorokea kokote kule, na liwe liwalo. &lsquo;Nitaacha kasri hili la shakawa na kutafuta usalama kokote. Hapo nitakuwa huru&nbsp;na jitu hili katili halitaweza kuniona tena.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hashimu alijua kwamba alihitaji ujasiri na uangalifu mwingi. Bila ya hayo mpango wake ungetumbukia nyongo. Basi siku moja alingojea mpaka giza tororo lilipoukumbatia usiku, kisha akatoroka bila kuonekana na yeyote. Alipofika mbali na kasri hilo alikimbia kwa mbio za farasi mpaka akafika katika msitu uliojaa miti kochokocho. Alipiga milundi kwa muda wa siku nyingi asipate hata mhisani mmoja, lakini haya yote hayakumfanya kughairi. Nguo zake zilichanwa na miiba na matawi ya miti. Njaa nayo ilimbana kwelikweli.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ghafla, aliona pango kubwa karibu naye. Akashusha pumzi akasema. &lsquo;Hatimaye nimepata mahali pazuri pa pumziko. Huyo mjalaana hatanipata.&rsquo; Hashimu aliingia pangoni, akawa yu hoi kwa uchovu. Mara akaanza kusinzia na kulala usingizi wa pono. Muda si muda aliamshwa na mngurumo mkali uliosikika kama radi. Humo mdomoni mwa pango mlisimama mfalme wa hayawani - simba. Akaanza kumkabili Hashimu. Kijasho chembamba kilianza kumtiririka huku akitamani ardhi ipasuke aingie. Hashimu alitetemeka kwa hofu alipoona jinyama hilo likimkaribia huku likiinua guu lake la kushoto. Lilinguruma kwa maumivu, kuonyesha kuwa lilihitaji kuauniwa. Hashimu alimeza mrututu na kuamua kulisaidia kwa kuung&rsquo;oa mwiba uliokuwa umelichoma guuni. Simba alivaa tabasamu na kutikisa mkia wake kumshukuru Hashimu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tangu siku hiyo Hashimu na simba wakawa marafiki wa kufa kuzikana. Waliishi pamoja kwa muda mrefu huku simba akimfadhili kwa mawindo. Usiku Hashimu na sahibu wake walilala pamoja pangoni, simba akililinda pango hilo.</p>\r\n",created:"2016-09-29T12:01:10.943390Z",subject:4,exam:125}],name:"Kiswahili KCPE

Wakenya hawakutaka kuitumia lugha ya Kiingereza kama lugha ya taifa. Hii ilionekana kuwa lugha ya kikoloni na kigeni. Hali ya kuwepo lugha nyingi nchini ilitatiza uchaguzi wa lugha moja. Kila kabila lilitarajia lugha yake kuchaguliwa, jambo ambalo lilikuwa gumu. Kuchagua Kiingereza hakungefaa kwani, mbali na wasomi raia wengi hawakukijua. Hata sasa wananchi wengi bado hawajakimudu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Serikali ilishughulikia swala hili la uteuzi. Hatimaye, Kiswahili kilitunukiwa hadhi ya kuchaguliwa. Kama lugha ya&nbsp; taifa, Kiswahili hutumika katika maongezi ya kawaida, mawasiliano ya kibiashara na&nbsp;kadhalika. Kiswahili kilichaguliwa kwa sababu kadhaa. Kwanza, baadhi ya wasomi walifikiri kwamba lugha hii ilikuwa na asili ya Kiarabu. Kwa sababu hii walifikiria kuwa kiswahili hakikuwa lugha ya kabila lolote. Pili, wengine waliamini kwamba Kiswahili ni mchanganyiko wa&nbsp;lugha ya Kiarabu na lugha za&nbsp;Kiafrika.&nbsp;Hivyo&nbsp;kingekubaliwa na makabila yote. Hata&nbsp;hivyo wasomi wengine walishikilia kuwa hii ilikuwa ni lugha ya Kiafrika asilia bila mchanganyiko wowote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hivi leo hakuna ubishi wowote kuhusu asili ya Kiswahili.

Alimaliza kazi chapu chapu tena kwa usahihi. Ila yake kubwa ilikuwa husuda. Jane alikuwa mfanyi kazi kwa akina Kevin. &lsquo;Mbona wazazi wangu wanampa Jane pesa chungu nzima na mimi hata nikisaidia sipewi japo senti moja? Kwa nini wazazi wakitoka, Jane anakuwa ndiye mkubwa wetu hapa? Wazazi wanamwamini sana, isitoshe wanamwachia pesa za matumizi. Lazima nitamchongea kwa wazazi afutwe kazi.&rsquo; Kevin akaamua.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Siku moja baada ya kufunga shule, Kevin alirudi nyumbani na matokeo mazuri ya mtihani. Alikuwa wa kwanza darasani. Wazazi wakafurahi na kumpongeza. Kevin aliona kuwa hiyo ilikuwa heko ya mdomo tu. Siku iliyofuata alianza kuchoma nguru. Jane alijaribu kujitetea juu chini lakini aliambulia patupu. Kwa hakika <u>ukweli wa mpita njia si uongo wa mwenye nyumba</u>. &nbsp;Akafunga virago vyake na kwenda zake akiwa amejawa na <u>simanzi</u> tele kwa kumwagiwa unga wake wa bure bilashi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asubuhi iliyofuata Kevin alidamka na kufanya kazi nyingi za ndani. &nbsp;Alipomaliza akatoka nje, akanadhifisha kiunga, akafua nguo na kupiga pasi. Akashughulikia maakuli ya mchana na kuandika meza. Aliwaita wadogo zake wakala na kuosha vyombo. Baadaye akawaambia wadogo zake waketi wasome. Wakamtii. Naye akafanya vivyo hivyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Punde si punde, Kevin akaanza kuhesabu kibunda chake cha siku. &lsquo;Leo nimefaulu kuwa <u>mfanyi kazi</u> bora kuliko Jane. Isitoshe, nimekuwa kiongozi hapa nyambani na hata pesa za masurufu nilizopewa nimefaulu kuzitumia ipasavyo.&rsquo; Baada ya hesabu ya uwongo na ukweli, aling&rsquo;amua kuwa siku hiyo angefaidika kwa kuzipata shilingi mia moja na &nbsp;hamsini. Hata hivyo mgongo wake ulimuuma ingawa ilikuwa tu siku ya kwanza. Aliamua kuwa kwa kazi zote alizofanya pamoja na usumbufu wa wadogo wake, angewahurumia wazazi kwa kuwadai shilingi mia moja tu. Malipo ya upishi hangewadai kwani ndio walionunua chakula. Mara akawaza, &lsquo;Niliwaleta wazazi ripoti nzuri sana mwisho wa muhula. Hivyo watanipa shilingi hamsini na zawadi juu yake.&rsquo; Akajitia kusoma huku akitabasamu na kuwangojea wazazi kwa hamu na ghamu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wazazi walipowasili walistaajabu na kuuliza kama Jane alikuwa amerudi kwani nyumba ilikuwa ni safi sana. Kevin alifurahi akawapokea mizigo. Aliwajibu kuwa ndiye aliyefanya kazi hizo zote. Wazazi wakafurahi sana na kuwahimiza watoto wao wote kujifunza kazi za mikono kama Kevin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mara Kevin akaonyesha kusinywa kwani heko za mdomo tu zilikuwa kwa si kitu. Mkono mtupu haulambwi.&nbsp;Akawakabithi wazazi ile ordha ya kazi alizozifanya <u>akitarajia kibindo kizito</u> ili awaringie nduguze. Wazazi walipoisoma, walitazamana kwa mshangao. Kisha wakamwita na kumketisha kitako wakampa pesa, akafurahi. Baadaye wakamwita na kumshauri, &lsquo;Sikiza vizuri. Sisi tulikuzaa, tukakulea kwa uchungu na gharama na bado tunaendelea kukutunza. Kwa hayo yote hatukudai na wala hatutakudai&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kevin kuyasikia hayo alifedheheka, akazijutia fikra zake finyu za kitoto. Alikuwa amesahau kwamba kuwasaidia wazazi ilikuwa ni jukumu lake. Alijuta kumwonea Jane wivu, akaomba msamaha kwa kumfitini. Aliwarudishia wazazi wake pesa walizokuwa wamempa.</p>\r\n',created:"2016-09-29T13:23:26.303135Z",subject:4,exam:127},{id:66,name:"KCPE 2002 ufahamu 2",statement:'<p><u><em>Soma habari ifuatayo kasha ujibu maswali 41 mpaka 50.</em></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Katika nchi nyingi zilizo maskini, vijana wengi wanaomaliza shule za msingi huridhika mapema. Wakikamilisha kiwango hicho hudhania kuwa wamepata elimu ya kutosha na wanaweza kufanya lolote. Wao husahau kuwa hicho walichosoma kitone na kionjo tu cha habari ya masomo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baadhi yao hufikiria kuwa wamekuwa watu wazima wafaao kuoa na kuolewa. Hawakumbuki kuwa &lsquo;watoto&rsquo; wakianza kupata watoto tena bila kujiweza kifedha ni kujididimiza katiaka ufukara. Wengine husinywa na masomo wakidai kuwa wamechoka. Huu ni uvivu ulioje! Elimu ni bahari kubwa isiyokauka daima dawamu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jambo la kusikitisha ni kuwa, baadhi yao hupenda kuendelea na masomo lakini hawatii bidii. Wanadhani kuwa wazazi wao ni fukara mno. Kukata tamaa huku si kuzuri kamwe. Ni bora kusoma kwa bidii kwani tumeshawahi kuona watoto wengi masikini waliofaulu sana wakipata wadhamini. Ni heri kufa macho kuliko kukata tamaa. Mtu asomaye na kufaulu hata akikosa kwenda sekondari, bado atathaminiwa na jamii yake na ataitumia elimu hiyo kujiimarisha maishani.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wengine huafaulu lakini shule huwa chache. Serikali inafanya juu chini kuongeza idadi ya shule. Vijana wanahimizwa wasome tu kwani hata kama watazikosa shule za upili wataweza kusomea kwenye vyuo vya ufundi. Kadhalika wanaweza kujiingiza katika masomo ya ngumbaru wakajisomea pole pole hadi chuo kikuu. Baada ya kumaliza wasipakate mikono na kusema kuwa hawatasoma tena. Wanapaswa kusoma magazeti, wasikilize taarifa za habari na ikiwezekana watazame runinga. Iwapo kuna maktaba za umma waende huko kusoma kwani ni rahisi sana mtu kuwa bongo-lala kama hasomi. kinolewacho ndicho kipatacho.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vijana wasiojiendeleza kielimu huweza kujiingiza kwa haraka katika anasa wasiozimudu. Maovu mengi huzidi nchini kama bongo hazitashughulishwa katika ujenzi wa taifa. Vijana watazidi kuwa kupe katika jamii badala ya kujitegemea. Mtegemea cha ndugu hufa maskini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nchi zote zinazotaka kutajika kuwa ni miongoni mwa mataifa yaliyoendelea lazima zihimize vijana wote wasome kwa bidii. Watobolewe ukweli kuwa kisomo hafifu hakimpeleki mtu popote. Umaskini uondolewe ili kila mtu aweze kusomesha wanawe. Ikibidi kisomo kiwe cha lazima hadi kidato cha pili au cha nne. Hili likikubalika, wanafunzi hawatakua tu kimwili bali kiakili pia. Matendo yao yatakuwa yanaonyesha busara zaidi na watajiendeleza kiuchumi. Ukosefu wa elimu ni hatari kwa usalama kwani huchangia kuongeza ujinga, umaskini na magonjwa.</p>\r\n',created:"2016-09-20T09:12:12.352735Z",subject:4,exam:127}],name:"Kiswahili KCPE

Wazazi wake waliamini kuwa, mtu akifunzwa kazi mapema, atakuwa mkakamavu maishani. <strong>Kwake Limbuka alichukulia kinyume</strong>. Kimoyomoyo, alijiambia kuwa akipata kazi aoe, kisha apate watoto, hatawasumbua. Alitia bidii shuleni na akapita mitihani yake ya viwango vya juu. Baadaye, akabahatika kama mtende, akavuka mabonde na milima hadi <strong>ughaibuni</strong> kuongezea masomo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Akawa bado ana lile dukuduku lake la hapo awali, aliziangalia familia za huko na kuvutiwa.Akathibitisha kuwa makuzi ya kikwao ni ya kishamba. Akasahau kuwa, kisomo cha kijadi alichopewa na wazazi kilikuwa ndicho chanzo cha ufanisi wake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Baada ya miaka si haba alirudi kwao, akaoa na kujaliwa watoto wawili. Alimwambia mkewe kuwa, yeye hatathubutu kushikilia makuzi ya kizamani. Hakujua kuwa mwacha mila ni mtumwa. Hapo basi wakawalea watoto kama mayai. Watoto walipoguswa kidogo, walishtakia hali kwa wavyele wao, nao waliwabwekea &ldquo;wachokozi&rdquo; kwa hasira. Watu wakabakia macho tu! Wakamngojea &ldquo;msema kweli wa maisha&rdquo;. Watoto wakaota pembe za kinyati. Kwa kukosa kazi yoyote, waloogiza lolote lile waliloiona katika runinga.Waliropokwa ovyo popote pale bila ya tahayuri yoyote. Walopokua wadogo walianza kunywa pombe, kuvuta sigara na kutumia madawa ya kulevya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Vituko vilipozidi na kuvuka mipaka, walianza kuwadharau na kuwaaibisha wageni maskini waliowatembelea huko kwa. Waliowahi kufika kwao kwa vigari vya spana mikononi walichekwa. Hata watoto walishangaa walipoona watu wakipanda &ldquo;matatu&rdquo; au &ldquo;mabasi&rdquo; <strong>Walipokwenda kuchukuliwa shule kwa gari walilolipuuza walijificha na kusema. &ldquo;Hilo ni gari la sokoni, halitufai.&rdquo;.</strong> Walipoingia kwenya maduka, walichagua bidhaa za bei ghali. Bwana Limbuka na mkewe waliridhi matakwa ya watoto wao wakidhani kuwa huko ndiko kupenda. Walisahau kuwa kuna leo na kesho. Wakasikika wakisema, &ldquo;Watoto safi sana hawa. Ni jasiri na werevu. Hawana undani wowote.&rdquo; Hawakukumbuka kuwa kuna yale yanayofaa kusemwa na kuna yale kumezea. Maneno mengine huchoma watu nyoyoni.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Watoto wa Limbuka walizidi kudidimia kisimani. Shule nayo ikawapiga chenga. Wakashindwa mitihani yao ya kidato cha nne. Katika hali ya kuokoa jahazi lililokuwa likizama, wazazi wakawapa mitaji ya kuanzisha biashara. Baada ya muda mfupi mambo yalivurugika. Mali yote ikafujwa kwa kasi kwani buyu la asali halichovwi mara moja. Mwishowe ukata uliwanyemelea wakawa maskini hohehahe wasioweza hata kuwasaidia wazazi wao wazee. Walibaki kuwayawaya mitaani na kuzubaliwa na walimwengu. Limbuka na mkewe nao walijufunza kuwa mtoto hakuzwi kwa kubwagiwa mapesa na kuengwaengwa. Anafaa kufunzwa jinsi <strong>ya kuukabili ulimwengu bila ya ketegemea nundu </strong>za wazazi.

Viumbe wengi wamepewa masikio mawili ya kunasia habari. Masikio hutakiwa kusafishwa vizuri wakati wowote mtu anapooga au kunawa. Nta za maskio hufaa kuondolewa kwa uangalifu. Baadhi ya watu huyaharibu maskio kwa kuyachokora kwa njiti za viberiti. Badala ya kuutoa uchafu huo vizuri, wanaukandamiza ndani ya sikio. Wengine huingiza vutu vingine visivyofaa wanapopatwa na mwasho masikioni. Je, umewahi kufikiria jinsi kidubwasha kilichotokomezwa na kudidimia sikioni, kinavyoweza kugusana na viungo vingine na kusababisha taabu kubwa? Idhihirike kuwa, kuingiza vijidude kama hivyo maskioni kutasababisha kuziba kwa maskio. Kuzibuliwa kwa masikio hayo huweza kugeuka kuwa ngoma goya na kusababisha uziwi. Uziwi wa kujitakia ni kama mtu <strong>kujipalia makaa.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Baadhi ya masikio huaharibika na sauti kubwa kama ya muziki. Redio na televisheni zinafaa kufunguliwa sauti za wastani. Sauti kubwa za kushtua moyo hazidhuru tu maskio, bali huweza kuleta maafa kwa wale wagonjwa wenye maradhi ya moyo. Ni vyema kuyajali maslahi ya wenzetu. Baadhi ya vijana huonea fahari hali hiyo ya kupandisha sauti za redio majumbani au kwenye &ldquo;matatu&rdquo;. Tabia hiyo hukera na huwaudhi hata wahusika wenyewe bila kujua. Isitoshe, hali hii huweza kuleta uhasama kwa majirani. Uangushaji wa vyombo kama vile sahani au vyuma pia huadhiri. Kelele zinazofanywa darasani au mikutanoni nazo hazifai. Kulitesatesa sikio kwa kuligotagota kila mahali pia huleta maumivu. Kutumia herini zenye madini hafifu yasiyopatana na ngozi ya mtu binafsi huleta usumbufu mkubwa. Wakati nywele zinapooshwa na kemikali kuachwa kuingia masikioni huwa ni ncha kali. Uvutaji wa masikiokama adhabu ni tabia isiyofaa kwani huhasiri masikio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Ni vyema mtu akiwa na shida amuone daktari ama sivyo madhara makubwa yatazuka. Wakati maskio yanapoanza kutoa usaha yatibiwe mara moja. Kutokwa kwa usaha ni dalili ya kuwa na <strong>kidonda kisichofaa kutafutiwa dawa za kiholela</strong>.&nbsp;Wataalamu wa maskio ndio tu wanaofaa kuhusishwa na matibabu hayo.</p>\r\n',created:"2016-10-03T08:56:34.462717Z",subject:4,exam:128}],name:"Kiswahili KCPE

Baadhi ya watu hutembea kwa muda mrefu kwa miguu kwa kuukosa usafiri wa haraka. Wengine hupanda hata ngamia ili wapige hatua. Pia, punda hutumiwa kusafirisha mizigo. Kwa wale waliodiriki &nbsp;kujinunulia magari, muda haupiti kabla ya ukarabati kuhitajika. Mamilioni ya magari ya aina hiyo &nbsp;huwa tu ni ya kubebebewa nyundo na parafujo kila wakati. Hali hii imezidishwa na barabara ambazo hazijatiwa lami au hata zikiwa zimetiwa, hupachikwa kiholela tu. Mashimo barabarani yanaharibu magurudumu na hata magari yenyewe. Isitoshe, ukata katika jamii unachangia uhaba wa magari mazuri na hata &nbsp;ubovu wa hayo machache. Hii ni kwa sababu watu hawana ngwenje za kunulia vipuri vifaavyo au kujinunulia magari mapya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Wengine hujikidhia mahitaji yao ya usafiri kwa kutumia baiskeli. Hizi zina nafuu kifedha kuliko magari, lakini haziwezi kubeba mizigo mingi na mizito. Wachache sana hutumia eropleni na meli ambapo wengi huweza kuyatumia magari moshi. Magari &nbsp;hayo na injini zao, zimesababisha ongezeko kubwa la nauli katika miaka za hivi karibuni. Watu wengi wanashindwa kuulipia usafiri huu. Baadhi yao huyadandiadandia magari hayo hadi paani mwa mabehewa na mabogi ili tu wakwepe kulipa nauli. Mtindo huu hautatizi tu shirika la reli bali huzua hatari kwa wasafiri. Baadhi ya wadandiaji huporomoka na Kujivunjia viungo, jambo ambalo huongeza idadi ya walemavu bure bilashi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Matatu na mabasi ni aina ya uchukuzi ambao ni maarufu nchini Kenya.

Mathalani, kudhibiti mwendo wa magari hayo, tabia za utingo na madereva na kujaza watu garini kama makopa. Zaidi ya hayo, imakuwa ni shida kuzidhibiti tabia za wale wapendao kurambishwa asali katika sekta hii.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Hivi majuzi, waziri wa usafiri na mawasiliano alifanya juu chini akaibuka na mikakati kabambe ya kuondoa udhia mwingi katika sekta ya usafiri. Aliwataka &nbsp;wenye magari kuweka vidhibiti mwendo, abiria kuitumia mikanda ya usalama, utingo na madereva kuvaa sare na magari kutobeba abiria kupita kiasi.

Ilikuwa siku yake ya pili katika ofisi hii kubwa. Kwa kweli, hakuna aliyeweza kufikiria kuwa kijana huyu angepata kazi nzuri kama hii. Wazazi wake, Bwana Chakavu na Bi. Tabu hawakuweza kupata elimu ya kisasa ambayo iliwawezesha marika zao kupata kazi za ajira ofisini. Wazazi hao wakabakia kufanya kazi katika mashamba na majumba ya matajiri.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ingawa Bwana na Bi. Chakavu walijitahidi kufanya kazi, pato walilopata halikuweza kutosheleza mahitaji ya watoto wao. Licha ya kushindwa kuwapa watoto hao lishe bora, wazazi hawa waliona vigumu sana kuwanunulia mavazi mazuri na hata kuwalipia karo ya shule, Maisha kwa Faraja na ndugu zake yakawa ya taabu na mashaka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ni kweli kuwa Faraja na ndugu zake walikuwa maskini wa mali. Hata hivyo, vijana hawa walikuwa matajiri wa akili. Akili zao zilikuwa kama visu vikali vinavyokata kwa ncha zote. Kila mara Faraja aliliongoza darasa lake. Ndugu zake pia walipata alama nzuri. Jambo hili liliwatia wazazi wao moyo, wakafanya kila juhudi kuwalipia karo. Hata hivyo, Faraja na ndugu zake walikuwa wakifukuzwa kuleta karo. Wanafunzi waliosoma na Faraja walipogundua kipawa chake, walianza kumheshimu na kumpenda. Hata wale waliomdharau kwa uhitaji wake walinong&rsquo;onezana kisirisiri wasije wakamuudhi. Kwa hakika, licha ya Faraja kuwa hodari masomoni, alikuwa karimu na mnyenyekevu. Hakusita kuwasaidia wale ambao walikuwa <strong>visu butu</strong> katika masomo mbalimbali. Jambo hili lilimfanya aendelee kupendwa na wanafunzi na hata walimu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wahenga walisema kuwa <strong>chanda chema huvikwa pete</strong>. Juhudi za Faraja shuleni zilimpa pato. Akawa mwanafunzi bora katika mtihani wa darasa la nane na kujiunga na shule moja ya kitaifa nchini. Haukupita muda kabla ya shida ya ukosefu wa karo kujidhihirisha. Bwana Chakavu akautafuta usaidizi asiupate. Faraja <strong>akaanza kuona kwamba kamba </strong><strong>yake ya matumaini inatishia kukatika.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hata hivyo, waliosema kuwa wema hauozi hawakukosea. Katika shule ya Faraja kulikuwa na mwanafunzi mmoja, aliyewahi kusaidiwa na Faraja masomoni wakiwa shule ya msingi. Mwanafunzi huyu kwa jina Tegemeo, alikuwa na wazazi waliojiweza. Aliwaomba wazazi wake wamsaidie Faraja, nao, kwa kujua umuhimu wa kuwaelimisha vijana, walijitolea mara moja kumlipia Faraja karo hadi kidato cha nne. Haya yalimpa Faraja nguvu mpya, akazama zaidi masomoni ili kuonyesha shukrani kwa wafadhili. Aidha, aliazimia kuwatua wazazi wake mzigo wa kuwakimu ndugu zake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hivi sasa Faraja ni mfanyikazi wa hadhi kubwa katika mojawapo ya mashirika ya serikali.

Watoto wanaojulikana kama chokora waliwaonyesha polisi kisanga. Walipanga njama za kutapakaza vinyesi katika vituo hivyo vya polisi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kisanga hiki kilichukuliwa na wengi kama ujinga, kichekesho na uchafu. Hata hivyo, tendo lilo likipigwa darubini linaweza kuzua mambo mengi ambayo yanapaswa kumulikwa. Hebu tujiulize kwanza: Ni nani aliye na akili timamu ambaye angeenda haja kubwa, kisha achukue kinyesi hicho na kukishika na kukitumia apendavyo bila kuhisi kinyaa? <strong><u>Bila shaka jibu la swali hili unalijua fika</u></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kisanga kama hicho huwa na chanzo chenye <u>kina</u> kirefu ambacho kisipochunguzwa kwa undani kinaweza hata kuangamiza nchi. Ajabu ni kuwa jamii yetu imejaa mapuuza kuhusu maswala ya watoto. Watoto wanachukuliwa kuwa hawana uwezo wa kujiamulia, kwa hivyo hawashirikishwi katika maswala mengi yanayohusu maisha yao. Kutokana na hali hii jamii imeshindwa kutambua shida za watoto hawa. Watoto wanapoona kuwa wanapuuzwa huamua kuchukua hatua mbalimbali kuishinikiza jamii kuwashughulikia. Kisanga kilichotokea katika vituo vya polisi ni njia mojawapo tu ya kuonyesha uchungu mkubwa walio nao watoto hawa. Jambo la kusikitisha ni kwamba wengi wetu hatujatafakari na kuvivumbua vilio vya watoto hawa. Badala yake, tunawachukua kama punguani, wachafu, wezi ... Wengi wapitapo karibu nao hufunga pua zao na kuchepukia mbali wakiwaambaa kama wagonjwa wa ukoma. Ni binadamu wachache sana ambao huthubutu kuwakaribia na kuwapa msaada. Hakuna wengi wanaosutwa na nafsi zao na kujishughulisha kusugua bongo na kujiuliza kwa nini watoto hawa wakageuka kuwa hivyo. Ukweli ni kuwa, hawa ni binadamu wenzetu. Kila binadamu anapaswa kjaliwa maslahi yake. Watoto wana haki ya kuishi hata kama ni maskini. Wanastahili kupendwa na kutimiziwa mahitaji yao ya kimsingi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jamii ina jukumu la kutafuta suluhisho la kudumu kuhusiana na hali ya watoto hawa. Kuna haja ya kuwa na mpango kabambe ya kukabiliana na tatizo hili sugu. Kwanza itabidi waketishwe kitako na kuhojiwa ili chanzo cha matatizo yao kijulikane. Huenda baada ya matatizo yao yanayowafanya wawe mitaani ni kukosana tu na wazazi, ndugu au walimu. Wengi wao wakipata washauri watakaowapa nafasi ya kujieleza, wataweza kukubali kurejea makwao. La sivyo wakiachwa waendelee kuzurura mitaani watakutana na &lsquo;walimu&rsquo; wabaya wa kuwapotosha zaidi. Ikumbukwe kuwa baadhi ya watoto wanaotoroka kwao, wafikapo mijini hukumbana na matatizo makubwa zaidi ya yale yaliyowatoa nyumbani. Ingawa wengi wao wangependa kurudi kwao, hawafanyi hivyo kutokana na woga na aibu. Watoto hawa wakiwahiwa mapema watarudi nyumbani na kuishi vyema. <em>Chuma kiwahi kingali moto</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aidha, watoto wanaopelekwa kwenye vituo vya kurekebishia tabia hawafai kuachwa kukaa bure. Wataanza kujitafutia &lsquo;vibarua&rsquo; na tutarudi palepale. Idara ya watoto na wahisani wengine washirikiane kuwapa makao ya kudumu na huduma kulingana na umri na vipawa. Tatizo la watoto hawa ni swala nyeti ambalo haliwezi kuachiwa polisi au mabaraza ya miji pekee. Ni tatizo la jamii husika. Ikumbukwe kuwa, watoto wanazo haki zao nyingi na zinafaa kutambulika zaidi ili <strong><u>tusije tukayaona ya Firauni</u>.</strong></p>\r\n",created:"2016-10-03T12:45:06.955589Z",subject:4,exam:130}],name:"Kiswahili KCPE

Wananchi katika nyanja mbalimbali hawana budi kuziimarisha nyanja hizi ili kuinua hali zao za maisha. Mathalani, wakulima watumie njia za kisasa za ukulima ili kuzalisha mazao mengi.

Wewe kama mwanafunzi, unaweza kuchangia maendeleo ya nchi hii kwa kushiriki kikamilifu katika shughuli zote za shule. Ujibidiishe vilivyo si katika masomo pekee, lakini pia katika michezo. Kwa kuiendeleza michezo ya riadha na hata ya kuigiza, utakuwa umeiendeleza nchi kwa kukuza utamaduni wako. Isitoshe, unaweza kushiriki katika shughuli za kuzoa taka katika mtaa ulio karibu na shule yako. Ukifanya hivyo utakuwa umeitikia wito wa serikali wa kuhifadhi mazingira.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sehemu za mashambani zinahitaji kushughulikulikiwa kimaendeleo. Licha ya kuwa sehemu nyingi zina rutuba, vijana wengi baada ya masomo huhiari kuhamia mijini kutafuta kazi zenye hadhi. Mashamba yameachiwa wazee na bila shaka mazao yamekuwa haba. Hebu tujiulize, je, ikiwa sisi vijana tutaziacha sehemu zetu na kuhamia kwingine, nani atakayeziauni? Je, hatujui kuwa chetu&nbsp; ni chetu na nguo ya kuazima haifai chochote? Ni vyema tukumbuke kuwa ikiwa tunataka kusaidiwa kuendeleza sehemu zetu, ni lazima sisi wenyewe tuwe tayari kuzitumikia kwani abebwaye hujikaza. Mapenzi kwa nchi ni muhimu mno.

Hata hivyo, siku zilivyosonga ndivyo tabia yake halisi ilvyonibainika.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jioni&nbsp;moja Tamasha alikuja chumbani mwangu akiwa amebeba unga aliouita dawa ya homa. Aliniambia nijaribu kutibu homa ambayo ilikuwa imenikaba kwa siku ayami. Name, kwa kutotaka kumkunja rafiki yangu, nikachukua unga huo na kuutia kinywani; ingawa kwa kweli mwalimu wetu alikuwa ametuonya dhidi ya kutumia dawa zozote bila maelekezo ya daktari. Unga huu haukuitibu homa yangu, ila ulinipa utulivu mkubwa wa akili, utulivu ambao sikuwa nimewahi kushuhudia maishani</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tamasha alifika chumbani mwangu usiku kunijulia hali. Alinipata nimejituliza juu ya kitanda changu. Alinisalimu na kukenua kama aliyetarajia jawabu fulani kutoka kwangu. Nilimweleza hali yangu naye akaniambia kuwa hivyo ndivyo dawa hiyo ifanyavyo kazi; kwamba amekuwa akiitumia kwa muda, hata nyakati za mtihani; naye hupata nguvu za kukabiliana na majabali yote. Alinielekeza kwa Mzee Kamaliza ambaye ndiye aliyekuwa akimuuzia unga huo. Kuanzia siku hiyo nikawa mteja mwaminifu wa Kamaliza. Nilitumia unga huu bila fikira nikidhani kuwa ilikuwa dawa ya homa tu! Sikujua ilikuwa dawa ya kulevya; na Tamasha alikuwa mraibu sugu wa dawa hiyo na nyingine nyingi! &ldquo;<u>Uzuri wake huu ni wa mkakasi tu</u>?&rdquo; Nilijiuliza. &ldquo;Laiti ningalijua&rdquo;. Hata hivyo maswali yote haya haykuwa ya faida tena. Nilikuwa tayari nimezama katika tatizo sugu la matumizi ya dawa za kulevya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nilijisuta moyoni kwa matumizi ya dawa za kulevya ambayo yalielekea kuyagongesha mwamba maisha yangu shuleni. Hata hivyo, haikuwa rahisi kuacha kwani nilichelea kuitwa limbukeni na wenzangu. Matokeo ya haya yote yakawa kuzorota kwa masomo yangu. Walimu hawakuchelewa kuona mabadiliko yaliyonukumba. Walijaribu kunishauri na kutaka kujua kilichokuwa kinanisumbua. Walipoona kwamba hali yangu haibadiliki na kwamba nimeshindwa kuwaambia tatizo langu, walimjulisha mwalimu wangu mkuu ambaye hakukawia kumwita baba.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mazungumzo kati ya baba na mwalimu mkuu yalinitia fadhaa kubwa kwani sikutaka kuwaambia nilitumia dawa za kulevya; ingawa kwa kweli mwalimu mkuu alishuku. Walijaribu kunishika sikio kuhusiana na tabia hii yangu; lakini tangu lini <u>sikio la kufa likasikia dawa?</u> Niliendelea na uraibu wangu hadi siku nilipofunzwa na ulimwengu baada ya kufumaniwa na naibu wa mkuu wa shule mjini nikipiga maji. Nilipewa adhabu niliyotarajia. Nilijipata nyumbani kwa muda wa mwezi mzima, nikiuguza vidonda vya moyo na akili. Kijiji kizima kilijua nimefukuzwa shule kwa sababu ya matumizi ya dawa za kulevya. Sikuwa na pa kuutia uso wangu. Hata hivyo hii ilikuwa tunzo kubwa kwangu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mama yangu aliweza kunipa nasaha na kunishauri niache kutumia dawa hizo. Mara hii, maneno aliyoniambia yalikuwa ya maana. Niliyasikiliza kwa makini. Hata baba alipopata barua kumwarifu anirejeshe shule, nilikuwa tayari kurudi na kuyaanza maisha upya. Nilikuwa nimeamua kujiunga na chama cha vijana wanaopigana na matumizi mabaya ya dawa shuleni.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",created:"2016-09-08T09:46:55.564553Z",subject:4,exam:132},{id:45,name:"KCPE 2007 Ufahamu 2 ksw",statement:"<p><em><u>Soma taarifa hii kisha ujibu maswali.</u></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mafunzo ya kuimarisha maadili katika jamii ni muhimu. Kinyume na hapo awali, sasa maadili ya jamii zetu yanayozoroteka kwa kasi sana kiasi cha kushangaza. Mwingiliano mwingi kati ya mataifa ya Kiafrika nay a kigeni unaweza kuleta upungufu wa maadili. Watu wengi hufikiria kwa upotovu wa maadili ndio ustaarabu ufaao. Kusifu na kuziiga nyendo mbaya huchangia upalilizi wa uozo wa tabia. Hali hii inaweza kuzifuja nchi hizi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ni dhahiri shahiri kuwa umaskini wa nchi umewafanya vijana kwa wazee kutamani na kuzitafuta njia za mkato za kujitajirisha. Kwa kuingiwa na tamaa nyingi, wao huanzisha miradi ya kifisadi. Watu hao hufanya juu chini kutafuta mianya ya kujipenyezea fedha. Wao hufanya haya bila ya kujali madhara yanayoletwa na hizo pilkapilka zao. Hongo huzidi kuendelezwa ili kuficha hizo njama ambazo huwa hatari kwa usalama wa nchi na watu wake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tamaa ikikithiri mpaka, bongo za fisadi hao hazitulii bali huenda kwa haraka isiyomithilika. Watu hujikweza wakitaka kuwafikia na kuwapita waliowatangulia kiuchumi. Mathalani, watu ambao hivi majuzi walionekana hoi ama watu wa kawaida, ghafla huonekana watu wa kuishi kitajiri huku wakijijengea majumba ya ghorofa katika mitaa ya kifahari. Kama hali hiyo ingeletwa na kushukiwa na nyota ya jaha, ungeelewa. Lakini kama utajiri huo unaotokana na kufurisha mifuko kwa kuleta shoti ofisini, wakitumia wizi wa kalamu au kula mlungula, itabidi utiliwe shaka na kulaaniwa. Vijana ambao ndio wajenzi wa taifa wa leo na kesho wanapaswa kuvipuuza vitendo hivyo kwa sababu vinadhalilisha utu wa jamii.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Serikali nyingi za Kiafrika hutafuta mikakati ya kukabiliana na ufisadi ili ziimarishe maadili. Mojawapo ya hiyo mikakati ni hatua ya serikali ya kuwahimiza wananchi kujaza fomu kuonyesha jumla ya rasilimali zao. Hata hivyo wahusika katika ufisadi hutafuta vizingiti vya kuzizuia juhudi hizo za serikali.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ni bayana kuwa mtu hawezi kushindana na mkono mrefu wa serikali. Juhudi za kukomesha vituko za ufisadi zimeanza kuzaa matunda. Tayari vielelezo vya kupambana na ufisadi vimeanza kujidhihirisha vyenyewe. Hivi majuzi vituko vya kujenga nyumba hafifu hapa nchini vilifuataliwa unyounyo na wahusika kufunguliwa mashtaka; hasa baada ya watu kupoteza maisha yao na wengine kulemazwa walipoangukiwa na nyumba hizo. Kwa mfano, watu waliodai kuwa watajenga ghorofa tatu, walibadili nia ya kujenga ghorofa zaidi. Walifanya hivyo baada ya kupata vibali vya pembe za chaki. Isitoshe, kwa kutaka kutajirika haraka walinunua na kuvitumia vifaa duni kinyume na kanuni za uhandisi. Mambo kama haya hujitokeza katika nchi katika nchi nyingi barani Afrika. Nchi hizi sasa zimeamka na kukaza kamba katika kuupinga ufisadi huu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ikumbukwe kuwa ufisadi unaotokana na ukosefu wa maadili ni hatari kubwa kwa nchi yoyote ile. Mienendo kama hii hufuja nchi husika. Ni vyema kuepuka tabia hizi kama mtu aepukavyo ugonjwa wa kuambukiza.</p>\r\n",created:"2016-09-08T09:59:37.336409Z",subject:4,exam:132}],name:"Kiswahili KCPE

Ulikuwa mwanzo wa siku ambayo kwake Tundu ilifanana na zingine za awali kama shilingi kwa ya pili. Katu haingempa matumaini mapya. Usiku uliopita <u>ulizongwa</u> na hamaniko na mavune makubwa kutokana na shughuli za kutwa shuleni. Kutwa hii alikuwa amepewa adhabu ya kupalilia shamba la shule baada ya kukosa kufanya zoezi la hesabu.Ingawa kufanya adhabu kulikuwa mazoea yake Tundu, hii ya leo ilikuwa ya kipekee kwani hata baada ya kuikamilisha, mwalimu mkuu alimpa nyongeza; alihitajika kufanya mazoezi mengine mawili zaidi na kumkabidhi mwalimu kesho yake asubuhi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tundu alijikokota kutoka kitandani kwa maumivu. Alijua kwamba hakuwa ameikamilisha kazi aliyopewa na mwalimu mkuu. Fikira ya kumkabili mwalimu mkuu ilimtia fadhaa ya ajabu,ila alifahamu sababu ya fadhaa yake. Vituko vyake vilikuwa vimewakaba walimu koo. Alikuwa hahudhurii madarasa yake kwa desturi. Mara nyingi alitoka nyumbani alfajiri na mapema. Hata hivyo hakudiriki kufika shuleni; japo kwa kweli alikuwa akivaa sare za shule kuwasadikisha wazazi kuwa anaenda shuleni. Wazazi wake walipojuzwa na walimu kuhusu tabia hii, walipigwa na butwaa wasijue la kusema. Waliwambia walimu kwamba kila siku Tundu alikuwa akiondoka akiwa amevaa sare kamili ya shule, na aliporejea nyumbani magharibi alifululiza chumbani kudurusu kazi yake. Laiti wangalijua kwamba Tundu alikuwa akivaa magwanda yake ya &lsquo;kazi&rsquo; ndani ya sare za shule na pindi tu apoteapo kwenye upeo wa macho ya wazazi, alikuwa akijitoma kwenye mashamba ya majirani kujichumia!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baada ya kupata staftahi yake ambayo kwa kweli ilikuwa chai ya mkandaa,&nbsp;<u>alivaa mavazi yake ya kawaida</u> na kujiambia kwamba leo atamngojea mwenzake njiani <u>waucheze &lsquo;mchezo&rsquo; wake wa kawaida.&nbsp;</u>Alipofika kwenye njia panda alivua sare yake ya shule na kubaki na vazi la &lsquo;kazi&rsquo;. Mwanafunzi mwenzake kwa jina Karaha alijiunga naye na baada ya Tundu kumwelezea kuwa alichelea kuongezewa adhabu na mwalimu mkuu, walikata shauri kulitembelea shamba la mwalimu mkuu ambalo lilikuwa mkabala na shule yao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shamba hili lilikuwa limeshiba miti iliyozaa matunda ya kila aina. Tundu, mate yalimdondoka alipokuwa akiyatundulia macho matunda haya. Umaskini wa familia yake ulisahaulika machoni pa utajiri huu asioulalia wala kuuamkia. Walinyata kimya kimya katikati ya miti hii, manyezi yakimkumbatia Tundu kwa nguvu. Hii haikuwa mara yake ya kwanza kufaidi jasho la wengine, hivyo hakusita kujiuliza sababu ya uoga huo. Jambo ambalo Tundu hakutambua kwamba <u>siku yake ya arubaini ilikuwa inabisha hodi.</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haukupita muda mrefu baada ya kuanza kuyatunda matunda kabla ya kusikia mrindimo wa nyayo. Karaha,ambaye hakuwa mzoefu wa vitimbi vya Tundu, alitoa macho pima kwa uoga. Tundu aliendelea kufurahia kiamsha kinywa chake hadi pale alipotahamaki kuguswa begani. Alipogeuka alijikuta ametazamana ana kwa ana na mwenye shamba. Tundu alishikwa na kitetemeshi asijue la kufanya. Alipoulizwa sababu ya tabia yake hii, alisema kwamba wazazi wake maskini hawakumudu kumtimizia mahitaji yake ya kimsingi.Karaha naye aliachama asijue la kufanya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mkuu wa shule alisikitishwa sana na kitendo cha wanafunzi. Alimshauri Tundu aache tabia hii na kuyazingatia masomo yake zaidi. Alimwonya Karaha dhidi ya kuwa bendera ambayo daima hufuata upepo. Aliwarudisha vijana hawa shuleni na baada ya kushauriana na walimu, alifanya mpango wa kumtafutia Tundu mshauri wa kumsaidia kurekebisha tabia yake.</p>\r\n",created:"2016-10-03T12:08:00.893235Z",subject:4,exam:148}],name:"Kiswahili KCPE 2009",exam_type:"KCPE",number_of_questions:50,description:"",price:50,preview:!0,subject:4},{id:135,questions:[{exam:135,text_resource:34,topic:{id:474,title:"Kifungu cha 1",chapter:67},question_number:1,statement:"<p>&nbsp;

Yatupasa tuepuke njia <u>zitakazotutumbukiza gizani</u>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daktari Busara ametuzungumzia kuhusu mwingiliano mbaya kati ya marafiki shuleni na hata nyumbani. Ni muhimu kuyaepuka makundi yanayoshinikiza utendaji maovu. Tuhimizane kusoma katika makundi na kubadilishana&nbsp; mawazo bora. Amesema kuwa michezo ni muhimu kwani ina faida nyingi. Miongoni mwa faida hizi ni kujenga mwili na kuchangamsha akili. Hata hivyo, amesisitiza tena kuwa kila jambo lina kipimo. kucheza sana bila kusoma, kutayaadhiri matokeo ya mtihani.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bwana Busara amesema kuwa, <u>maisha ya kesho hujengwa na maisha ya leo</u>.

Jinsi tunavyosoma sasa ndivyo tutakavyojiokoa kesho. Tukiuendekeza ugoigoi hatutafua dafu abadan! Tukumbuke <u>tukilima pantosha tutavuna pankwisha</u>. Tuamke!

Kila taifa limetengwa na kubainishwa kwa mipaka yake ya kitaifa iliyopangwa kwa sababu za kisiasa zinazohusisha misingi na utawala. Kutokana na mipaka hii, mataifa mengine ni madogo kama vile Rwanda na Burundi, na mengine ni makubwa kama Tanzania ,Kongo na Kameruni. Ifahamike kwamba ukubwa au udogo si hoja kwa taifa ikiwa linaweza kijisimamia. Bora tu pawe na serikali inayotekeleza majukumu yake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kwa ajili ya kitofauti za kitaifa, yamkinika ingekuwa vigumu sana kwa utawala mmoja kumiliki na kudhibiti eneo lote la Afrika mashariki na kati. Fikiria jinsi serikali moja inavyoweza kutawala kuanzia visiwa vya Lamu kule upwa wa pwani hadi kufikia Kameruni, upande wa Afrika Magharibi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kuna umuhimu wa kuweka mipaka ya kitaifa. Jambo la kwanza ni kurahisisha utawala. Kwayo serikali huweza kutekeleza miradi yake kwa urahisi katika eneo lake. Hali kadhalika, watu wanaoishi katika&nbsp; eneo&nbsp; moja hujenga uhusiano wa karibu na kufahamiana vyema. Hali hii hukuza ushirikiano zaidi. Umuhimu mwingine hujitokeza kwa upande wa kujenga hisia za umoja miongoni mwa watu wote wanaoishi katika eneo moja. Umoja huu huwa na mvuto wa kidugu unaotia watu ari ya kutaka kujitambulisha kama raia wa sehemu moja. Bila hisia za <u>umoja na udugu kwa hakika haingewezekana kuwa na taifa madhubuti</u>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mbali na mipaka kuna tamaduni na mila za kiasili zinazozibainisha jamii mbalimbali. Tukiangazia upande wa vyakula itadhihirika kuwa, vile vilivyozoeleka eneo moja ni tofauti na vyakula kawaida vya eneo lingine. Kwa mfano katika mataifa ya Afrika Magharibi hasa Nigeria, chakula chao mahsusi huitwa &lsquo;foo foo.&rsquo;&nbsp;Nchini Kenya ugali ndicho chakula cha muhimu miongoni mwa jamii nyingi. Waganda hupendelea &rsquo;matoke&rsquo; zaidi. <u>Mazoea yana</u> <u>taabu</u>. Mtu huenda asitosheke na mapochopocho ya biriani na pilau mfululizo, bila kuonja chakula chao asilia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mavazi pia ni mojawapo ya vitambulisho vya tamaduni za jamii mbalimbali. Mathalan, Afrika Magharibu ni maarufu sana kwa mavazi yao ya aina ya vitenge vilivyotiwa nakshi na kushonwa kwa umaridadi. Nyuzi za rangi ali ali hutumiwa kuongeza urembo wa vitenge kuthibitisha kwamba <u>ukiviona vinaelea jua vimeundwa</u>. Mavazi haya huvaliwa na wanawake na wanaume, tofauti zikijitokeza kwenye mitindo na mishono. La ziada, wanaume hukamilisha vazi lao kwa kuvaa kofia maalum. Wanawake nao hujifunga kitambaa kila mmoja kwa ufundi wake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kila taifa lina lugha yake maalum ambayo hujulikana na hutumiwa na raia wake kama lugha unganishi. Lugha hii teule huitwa lugha ya taifa na inatumika katika shughuli za kiserikali, biashara na mawasiliano ya kila siku miongoni mwa wanajamii.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Katika mataifa ya Kenya na Tanzania, Kiswahili kimetumiwa kwa miaka mingi kama lugha ya taifa. Kwa upande mwingine, Luganda ndiyo lugha iliyopewa kipaumbele huko Uganda japo Kiswahili hutumiwa pia. Nchini Kongo kuna baadhi ya lugha teule za taifa zikiwemo Lingala na kingwana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ni kweli nchi za Afrika zina mengi yanayofanana kama vile uwa na historia ya kutawaliwa na wakoloni, mali ya asili kama vile machimbo ya migodi, shehena za kitamaduni zikiwemo ndoa na posa. Hata hivyo, ibainike kuwa kila jamii ina tamaduni zake mahsusi zinazoitofautisha na nyingine. Ni muhimu kujivunia tamaduni hizo kwani mwacha mila ni mtumwa.</p>\r\n",created:"2016-09-08T09:33:02.911759Z",subject:4,exam:135}],name:"Kiswahili KCPE

Vyama vya wanafunzi shuleni vinachangia pakubwa kupitisha mafunzo hayo ya ziada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vyama vya wanafunzi hutofautiana kulingana na majukumu. Mathalani, vipo vyama vya kidini, vya kitaaluma na vya michezo. Pia, kuna vyama kijamii kama vile Chama cha kupambana na Matumizi Mabaya ya Dawa na vya kiuchumi kama vile Chama cha Wakulima Chipukizi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imedhihirika kwamba vyama vya wanafunzi vina <strong><u>manufaa ya kuhusudiwa.</u></strong> Hii ndiyo sababu shuleni, kila mwanafunzi anahimizwa kujiunga na angaa vyama viwili. Vyama vya wanafunzi huwasaidia kukuza vipawa na kuimarisha stadi za kujieleza. Haya hufikiwa kupitia kwa shughuli za vyama kama vile ukarir wa mashairi, mijadala, utegaji na uteguaji wa vitendawili, chemsha bongo na ulumbi. Aidha, vyama&nbsp; huhimiza&nbsp; utangamano miongoni mwa wanachama kwani wao hujiona kuwa watu wenye mwelekeo mmoja. Vilevile utangamano wa kitaifa na kimataifa hujengeka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mwanafunzi ambaye amejiunga na vyama vya wanafunzi huweza kukabiliana na changamano za maisha kwa urahisi kuliko yule ambaye hajawahi kujiunga na chama chochote. Katika vyama hivi, wanafunzi hufunzana mikakati na maarifa ya kutatua matatizo na mbinu za kuepuka mitego ya ujana. Kupitia kwa ushauri wa marika kwa mfano, mwanafunzi hushauriwa kuhusu maswala kama vile uteuzi wa marafiki, kuratibu muda, kujikubali na kuwakubali wenzake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hali kadhalika, mwanafunzi hujifunza maadili ya kijamii na kidini. Kupitia kwa vyama vya kidini na vinginevyo, yeye hujifunza na kuwa na stahamala ya kidini, kiitikadi na kikabila. Kadhalika, majukumu ambayo mwanafunzi huenda akapewa hupalilia uwajibikaji, uaminifu na kipapwa cha uongozi. Hata anapohitimu masomo yake, mwanafunzi huyu huendeleza sifa hizi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vijana wana nafasi kubwa katika kukabiliana na maovu ya kijamii kwani wao ndio wengi zaidi.&nbsp;Kupitia kwa vyama hizi, wanafunzi wanaweza kuwahamasisha wenzao dhidi ya tabia hasi kama vile kushiriki mapenzi kiholela, ulanguzi wa dawa za kulevya na kujiingiza katika burudani zisizofaa. Pia, shughuli na miradi ya vyama hivi huwawezesha wanafunzi kutumia nishati zao kwa njia ya kujinufaisha na kuepuka maovu. Kwa mfano, wanaweza kwenda kukwea mlima, kufanya matembezi ya kukusanya pesa za kuwafadhili wahitaji, kuendeleza shughuli za kunadhifisha mazingira na kutembelea vituo vya mayatima na wazee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kushiriki katika vyama vya michezo hakumwezeshi mwanafunzi kuimarisha afya na kujenga misuli tu mbali pia huweza kuwa msingi wa kupata chanzo cha riziki badaaye. Wapo wachezaji maarufu ambao walitambua na kuviendeleza vipawa vyao kupitia kwa vyama vya aina hii, sasa wana uwezo wa kuyaendesha maisha yao na familia zao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ifahamike kuwa vyama vya wanafunzi vinapaswa kuwa na msingi wa mshikamano na maridhiano. Visitumiwe kama vyombo vya kuwagawa wanafunzi kitabaka. Mwanafunzi hana budi kusawazisha muda anaotumia. Atenge muda wa shughuli za vyama na kudurusu masomo yake.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",created:"2016-09-19T08:37:26.612614Z",subject:4,exam:136},{id:20,name:"KCPE 2011 ufahamu 2",statement:"<p><em><u>Soma kifungu kifuatacho kisha ujibu maswali 41-50</u></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Naikumbuka siku hiyo vizuri. Niliamka alfajiri mbichi tayari kuanza safari kutoka kijijini mwetu hadi Mji Mkuu. Hii ndiyo ilikuwa mara yangu ya kwanza kuuzuru mji huu. Moyoni nilikuwa na bashasha isiyokuwa ya kawaida kwa sababu siku hiyo ningeuona mji ambao sifa zake nilikuwa nikizisikia tu kutoka kwa wenzangu waliobahatika kuutembelea. Hamu ya kuona majengo marefu, barabara zilizosakifiwa, magari mengi, watu wa asili mbalimbali na mabustani ya starehe ilinigubika, nikawa sijifai kwa matumaini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nilitembea hatua chache hadi kituo cha mabasi, nikapata daladala moja iliyotoza nauli nafuu, nikaiabiria mpaka mji uliuokuwa pua na mdomo kutoka kitongojini mwetu. Hapo nilitumainia kupata matwana ya kusafiria hadi Mji Mkuu. Kwenye stesheni kulikuwa na msongamano wa matwana na harakati za utingo waking&rsquo;ang&rsquo;ania abiria. Nikaingia katika matwana moja iliyoitwa Upepo. Nilikuwa abiria wa kumi na mbili kuingia. Baada ya dakika tano hivi, gari lilijaa abiria, wote kumi na wannne. Tukang&rsquo;oa nanga. Mandhari ya kupendeza yalijikunjua mbele yangu. Upepo mwanana kupitia dirishani, pito wa kasi wa miti, mazigazi&hellip;vyote vilishirikiana kunipumbaza kiasi cha kunisahaulisha kufunga mkanda wa usalama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baada ya robo saa utingo alidai nauli. Nikapeleka mkono kwa tahadhari kwenye <strong><u>kibindo</u></strong> changu ambamo nilikuwa nimezifutika hela za usafiri na masurufu. Nikatoa noti ya shilingi mia mbili na kumkabidhi utingo huku nikitarajia baki. Utingo alinikazia macho, akanyoosha mkono na kusema, &ldquo;Mia zaidi!&rdquo; nikarudi tena kwenye kibindo, nikatoa noti mbili za shilingi hamsini na kumpa. Safari ikaendelea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tulipofika mji mdogo wa Pitia, matwana ilisimama. Utingo aliinamia chini ya viti, akatoa vibao na kuviweka baina ya viti vya kawaida. Kisha akaanza kutangaza, &ldquo;Wa jiji na mia ; mia hamsini&rdquo;, Abiria walionekana kuwa wachovu wa kungojea na kupigwa na mzizimo wa kipupwe walipigana vikombo kuingia, huku utingo akiwaelekeza kwenye vile vibao. Viti vilivyotengenezewa abiria watatu vikaishia kubeba abiria watano! Matwana nayo ikawa haina budi kustahimili uzito wa abiria ishirini na watatu. Tukawa tunabanana kweli kweli. Utingo naye alining&rsquo;inia mlangoni, shati lake lapeperushwa na upepo. Nilipojaribu kulalamika hali hii nilinyamazishwa hata na abiria wenzangu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gari likaanza mwendo tena huku likiendeshwa kwa kasi ya umeme. Abiria waliokuwa wakizungumza sasa walinyamaza, kila mmoja roho i mkononi, kimya cha kaburi kiakatawala hadi pale utingo alipomwambia dereva, &ldquo;Weka ngoma.&rdquo; Muziki ukaanza kwa fujo. Baadhi ya abiria wakaanza kuyumbisha vichwa kwa kufuata mdundo wa muziki ambao ulitisha kuvipasua viwambo vya masikio yangu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Njiani tulikutana na walinda usalama ambao walitusimamisha. Utingo alishuka na kwenda chemba na mmojawapo wa hao maafisa, kisha akarudi huku kipaji chake kimenawiri kwa tabasamu. Akasema &ldquo;Nimempaka mafuta viganjani.&rdquo; Baadhi ya abiria walitikiswa vichwa, wengine wakacheka kama kwamba wameona kinyango. Mimi nilibaki kuduwaa tu. Gari liliongeza mwendo na baada ya muda mfupi tukafika kwenye mji mmoja ambao ulikuwa na majengo makubwa makubwa. Nikadhani tumefika Mji Mkuu. Nilipomuuliza abiria jirani aliniambia kuwa huu ulikuwa tu mji mkuu wa Jimbo la Buraha. Tukazidi kuyakunja masafa ya safari hii kwa kasi ya kuogofya&nbsp; huku dereva akitafuna majani aliyokua akiyatoa mfukoni mwa shati lake. Kadiri alivyotafuna ndivyo alivyozidisha kasi. Nikahisi kama gari linapaa juu angani. Nikataka kumwambia dereva jambo, lakini nikajiasa, &ldquo;ikiwa wengine wamenyamaza sembuse mimi?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baada ya kitambo kidogo mvua ilianza kunyesha. Kukawa na ukungu na utelezi barabarani. Abiria mmoja alimsihi dereva kupunguza mwendo. Haya hayakumgusa dereva mshipa. Aliongeza kasi kana kwamba hajasikia lolote. Gari lilifika kwenye kruba, dereva akawa haoni vizuri. Ghafla nikaskia, &ldquo;Kirrr..!&rdquo; Kisha, &ldquo;Mungu wangu!&rdquo; halafu, &ldquo;ngu!&rdquo; <strong><u>Kiza cha kaniki kikatanda.</u></strong></p>\r\n",created:"2016-09-19T08:38:08.649765Z",subject:4,exam:136}],name:"Kiswahili KCPE 2011",exam_type:"KCPE",number_of_questions:50,description:"",price:50,preview:!0,subject:4},{id:137,questions:[{exam:137,text_resource:94,topic:{id:474,title:"Kifungu cha 1",chapter:67},question_number:1,statement:"<p>&nbsp;

Ipo ile&nbsp;ya kuiasili kama vile Msitu wa Karura na Msitu wa Mau. Hali kadhalika, ipo misitu ya kupandwa kama ile ya Kinale na Webuye. Misitu ni hazina kubwa kwa jamii yoyote ile. Kila mwanajamii anapaswa kujivunia misitu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Misitu husheheni miti ya aina nyingi ambayo, pamoja na kuwa makazi ya wanyama, hutoa vyakula kama vile matunda na majani ambayo huwafaidi binadamu na viumbe wengine. Bila misitu binadamu na wanyama wangeangamia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Misitu ni kivutio cha watalii. Watalii kutoka ndani na nje ya nchi huzuru misitu na mbuga mbalimbali za wanyama kuajibia uzuri wake.Watalii hawa hulipa fedha za kigeni ambazo hutumiwa kuanzishia miradi ya kiuchumi kama vile</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fauka ya hayo, misitu husafisha hewa na kurembesha mandhari wanamoishi binadamu. Rangi ya kijani kibichi na maua yenye rangi tofautitofauti huyafanya mazingira kupendeza hata yakitazamwa kwa mbali. Mandhari yasiyo na miti hayakosi urembo tu, bali huwa wazi kiasi kwamba hata mapaa ya majengo yaliyo hapo wakati mwingine hupeperushwa na upepo mkali.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vipindi virefu vya jua huwanyima viembe starehe na huweza kusababisha saratani ya ngozi kwa binadamu. Miti hufanya vivuli ambavyo huwakinga watu na wanyama dhidi ya miale ya jua. Isitoshe, si ajabu kuwa mahali ambapo pana miti mingi kwa kawaida hupata mvua hata wakati usio wa majira ya mvua kwingineko.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sekta ya tiba imefaidika si haba kutokana na miti. Matibabu wa kienyeji na hata wa kisasa hutumia mizizi, majani na magombe ya miti kutengeneza dawa. Miti kama vile mwarubaini hutibu magonjwa mengi. Hivi sasa magonjwa kama vile bolisukari, shinikizo la damu na ugonjwa wa figo yameweza kudhibitiwa kwa kutumia dawa zinazotokana na miti. Inasemekana kuwa hata nyoka humtibu nyoka mwenzake kwa majani!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miti hutumiwa viwandani kutengenezea bidhaa kama vile karatasi na samani. Viwandani hivi hutoa ajira kwa maelfu ya raia, hivyo kupunguza makali ya uhaba wa nafasi za kazi nchini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ni wazi kuwa uhifadhi wa misitu una manufaa tumbi nzima kwa binadamu.Hata hivyo, binadamu mwenyewe ndiye anayeiangamiza misitu wenyewe. Watu wenye mate ya fisi wamekata miti kiholela kwa ajili ya kupata kuni na kuchomea makaa ya kuuza. La kusikitisha ni kwamba watu hawa hawadiriki kupanda miti mingine kufidia ile waliyoikata. Wengine, kwa kutojua wanajipalia makaa, hupanda miti ambayo inakausha&nbsp;vyanzo vya maji na&nbsp;kuchangia kuenea kwa kasi kwa jangwa. Hali kadhalika, wapo warina asali ambao katika juhudi zao za kurina husababisha kuteketea kwa misitu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kifungu cha katiba kinachohusu mazingira na mali ya asili kinasisitiza suala la uhifadhi wa mazingira. Kila mwanajamii basi ana jukumu la kuilinda misitu na kuepuka mazoea ambayo yanaiangamiza, la sivyo tutakuwa tunajichimbia kaburi.</p>\r\n",created:"2016-10-25T09:09:15.730510Z",subject:4,exam:137},{id:97,name:"KCPE 2012 Ufahamu 2",statement:"<p><em><u>Soma kifungu kifuatacho kisha ujibu maswali 41 mpaka 50.</u></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tenga alilelewa katika mazingira&nbsp;yaliyojaa neema, furaha na uchangamfu. Wazazi wake Bwana Mtanga na Bi. Zuhura walikuwa wakwasi wa kutajika katika janibu hizo, si kwa mali tu bali kwa nyoyo zao zilizokuwa&nbsp;tayari kila mara kuwakirimu wanakijiji kwa lolote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bwana Mtanga na Bi. Zuhura hawakulala maskini wakaamka matajiri. Mtanga alianza kazi kama tarishi katika Makavazi ya Umma. Ingawa hii ilikuwa kazi ya kijungu jiko mekoni, Mtanga <strong>hakwenda nguu</strong>; alijitahidi kwa vyovyote vile kujinyanyua. Akajisajili kwa kozi mbalimbali za usimamizi wa makavazi na kuhitimu vyeti tofautitofauti vikiwemo stashahada na shahada katika masuala ya usimamizi wa mashirika ya umma. Jitihada zake zikazaa matunda. Akapandishwa cheo mwaka baada ya mwingine hadi akawa msimamizi wa Makavazi ya Umma. Baadaye akaajiriwa na shirika la Msalaba Mwekundu kama Mkurugenzi wa Huduma za Kijamii.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bi. Zuhura naye, baada ya kuhitimu masomo ya shule ya upili ,alisomea taaluma ya ukutubi na baadaye kuajiriwa katika maktaba&nbsp;ya chuo kikuu cha Tungama. Hapa Zuhura alitambua kuwa amepata nafasi adimu ya kuutia makali ubongo wake. Akajisajili kwa kozi ya ukutubi na kuhitimu shahada ya daraja la kwanza katika taaluma hii. Wakuu wake kazini wakavutiwa na juhudi zake na kumpandisha cheo, akawa Mkutubi Mkuu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wakati Bwana Mtanga na Bi. Zuhura walipokuwa wakijiendeleza kitaaluma&nbsp;na kiuchumi, Tenga naye alikuwa anajikulia tu kama uyoga bila mpalilizi. Nyadhifa za wazazi wake zilimpokonya Tenga ushirika wa wazazi wake. Ile michezo yake na wazazi wake kabla ya chajio, yale matembezi kila Jumapili&hellip;yote yakatoweka. Baba na mama wakawa wanarudi nyumbani baada ya saa usiku wakiwa wametoka kwenye masomo ya kuupiga msasa ujuzi wao; Jumamosi na Jumapili wana majadiliano na wanafunzi wenzao. Nyakati nyingine wazazi&nbsp;wote wawili walikuwa kwenye safari za kikazi. Nyakati kama hizi Tenga angepelekwa kwa shangazi ambako angekaa na kijakazi wake kwa wiki tatu; anaenda shuleni na kurudi huko huko kwa shangazi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wahenga walisema kwamba, akosae la mama hata la mbwa huamwa. Pengo la malezi lililoachwa na wazazi wa Tenga lilijazwa na walezi wengine, wakiwemo vijakazi, shangazi, marika, walimu, majirani na hata vibonzo!Tenga alijifunza mengi kutokana na walezi hawa. Alifunzwa namna ya kupigana miereka, kutumia ujanja kujitoa katika matatizo, kutumia maneno makali <strong>kujihami</strong> alipochokozwa na wenzake, pamoja na mitindo mbalimbali ya kujinadhifisha.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mafunzo ambayo Tenga aliyapata, hasa kutoka kwa marika, yaliutia ila mwenendo na uhusiano wake na walimu. Darasani akawa haishi kuvuruga masomo kwani kila mara angetenda kituko ili mwalimu na wanafunzi waubaini uwepo wake. Vituko hivi vilisababisha kudorora kwa alama zake. Walimu wakajaribu kuurekebisha utundu wake lakini zikawa kama juhudi za mfa-maji. <strong>Tabia ya Tenga haikuwa ufa tena bali ukuta ambao ulihitaji kujengwa upya</strong>. Mkuu wa idara ya Ushauri na Uelekezaji shuleni ilibidi ahusishwe. Akamhoji Tenga na kupambaukiwa na vitendo vya Tenga vilikuwa na asili&nbsp;ambayo ilihitaji kuchunguzwa. Akampendekezea mwalimu wa darasa kuwashirikisha wazazi katika kutafuta mbinu za kumwelekeza Tenga zaidi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bwana Mtanga na mkewe Zuhura walipoambiwa kuhusu hali ya Tenga walipigwa na bumbuazi. Hawakuwa wameyawazia madhara ya kutoshiriki kikamilifu&nbsp;katika malezi ya mtoto wao. Mwalimu&nbsp;aliambiwa ya kwamba nusura Tenga aingiziwe na wenzake katika matumizi ya dawa za kulevya lakini akakataa na kusema kuwa hata babake hakujaribu kutumia kileo chochote. Wazazi waliona haya na kujilaumu. Hata hivyo walishukuru ya kwamba walimu waliyagundua matatizo haya kabla hayajaiangamiza familia yao.</p>\r\n",created:"2016-10-25T09:08:51.478853Z",subject:4,exam:137}],name:"Kiswahili KCPE

Kisha akajisemea kimoyomoyo, &rdquo;Wanafunzi hawa wana bahati yam mtende. Wangejua kilichowapata wasichana wa enzi zetu, katu wasingezembea masomo. Wangejua hatua kubwa iliyopingwa na dada zao wangewaiga na kuzidi kufungua macho na kuikumbatia hamu ya kusoma zaidi.

Sasa nataka nigange yajayo. &rdquo;Wakaendelea kusikiliza hotuba hizi na zile za kusifu hatua mbalimbali zilizopigwa katika kuinua kiwango cha elimu cha wanawake pale pao Shimoni. Mara kwa mara, Maridhia alisikia jina lake likitajwa nakumiminiwa sifa kemkem na shukurani tele.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maridhia alizirudisha fikira zake nyuma tena, akakumbuka vile alivyosma kwa shida licha ya kuwa wazazi wake hawakuwa wachochole. Alikumbuka vile wazazi hao walivyomnyima fursa ya kujiunga na shule ya upili kwa kufuata misimamo hasi ya wakazi wa Shimoni wa wakati huo. Hawa waliandama fikira kuwa kumsomesha msichana ni kupoteza mali bure. Wazazi wa Maridhia, kwa kuongozwa na tama, wakamuoza kwa babu mmoja mkwasi kupindukia. Ilibidi Maridhia akubali uamuzi huu shingo upande. Maridhia alikumbuka jinsi alivyoteseka katika ndoa hiyo. Alikumbuka vipigo vya kila mara, vicheko, vitisho na kuaibishwa hadharani na jamii, hasa ilipotokea kuwa amechelewa <strong>kuipata mbeleko. </strong>&nbsp;Mambo yalipomfika kooni akasema,&rdquo; Potelea mbali, liwe liwalo, hata wakisema mwacha mila ni mtumwa ni sawa. Maneno matupu hayavunji mifupa.&rdquo; Baada ya kuwaza na kuwazua Maridhia alifuata maarifa ya kujinasua, akamwendea Bi salama na kumlilia shida. Bi Salama alimshauri ajiunge na kituo cha elimu ya watu wazima, Huko Maridhia alipewa mafunzo mengi. Alitia shime masomoni akiamini kuwa kisomo hakina umri wala mwisho, akasoma hadi chuo kikuu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baada ya kuhitimu chuoni alirudi kwao na kupata kazi ambayo ilimwezesha kuwakimu wazazi wake waliokuwa wazee. Aidha alianzisha miradi mbalimbali Shimoni. Mafanikio ya Maridhia yaliwasuta na kuwaaibisha kindanindani wale waliomdulumu awali. Wengine walimsinhizia hili na lile. Hata hivyo, hawangeweza kufanya lolote kuizima kiu ya Maridhia ya kujiendeleza. Maridhia aliwapuuza akisema asilani jua haliwezi kuzuiwa kwa ungo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miaka mitatu baada ya Maridhia kupata kazi walirudiana na mumewe. Mumewe alimwomba msamaha naye Maridhia akamsamehe. Aliwasamehe pia wote waliomtesa. Aliwaona kuwa walioongozwa na itikadi zilizopitwa na wakati. Aliwaelimisha wanakijiji kuwa ni muhimu kumsomesha mwanamke pia. Wasibague. Mwanamke mmoja akielimishwa, huelimisha dunia. Maneno ya Maridhia yalimtoa nyoka pangoni, watu wakawasomesha wana wa jinsia zote, Shimoni ikaanza kupiga hatua kubwa sana kimaendeleo. Shule zilijengwa, miundomsingi kama vile barabara ikaimaishwa na hospitali zilizokuwepo zikaboreshwa. Maji ya mabomba yalisambazwa vijijini, chombo kilichokuwa kinaelekea kuzama kikaokolewa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sifa za</strong> <strong>Maridhia zilivuma pembe zote za shimoni na jamii jirani. </strong>&nbsp;Wazazi na walezi waliwapigia watoto wao mfano wa Maridhia ambaye aliweza kuzikosoa mila duni na akafaulu. Jambo hilo lilionekana kuwa mwiko hapo awali.

Malezi yake basi yangeweza kutabiriwa. <strong>Alilelewa kwa tunu na tamasha</strong>, <strong>asijue maana ya msamiati wa kukosa</strong>. Wazazi wake walikuwa wafanyabiashara maarufu ambao walisaﬁri nchini na ng&rsquo;ambo&nbsp;kwa shughuli hizo. Hata hivyo, hawakukosa muda wa kutangamana na mwanao. Walimwelekeza na kumfunza maadili na kanuni za kijamii, si kwa maneno tu, bali pia kwa vitendo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Miongoni mwa mambo ambayo wazazi wa Shawe walitilia maanani ni umoja na mshikamano wa kijamii. Pamoja na kwamba walikuwa kiguu na njia katika kujiinua kiuchumi, hakuna sherehe ya kijijini, iwe harusi au matanga waliyokosa kuhudhuria. Wakali ambao mmoja wao alikuwa safarini, mwenzake alimwakilisha. Wanakijiji waliwapenda na kuwastahi, nao wakawa hawaishi kumsiﬁa Shawe ukarimu na uchangamfu wa wanakijiji. Walimshauri kuhusu umuhimu wa kushirikiana na wengine na kumtahadharisha kuwa mm pweke ni uvundo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Shawe aliendelea kukua, akarithi labia ya wazazi wake ya kuinamia cha mvunguni; akawa mwanafunzi hora masomoni, tena mtiifu kwa walimu na hata majirani. Bidii yake ilizaa matunda, akapanda ngazi moja hadi nyingine kielimu, akaﬁkia kilele cha elimu yake chuoni alipohitimu shahada ya tatu. Baadaye alipata kazi nzuri na kupanda madaraka kutokana na bidii yaks. Baada ya kudunduliza pesa za kulosha za kuikimu familia, Shawe aliamua kuoa. Hapa ndipo maisha yake yalipochukua mkondo mwingine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Shawe alijikuta amekabiliwa na mabadiliko ya kihali ambayo hakuyawazia. Awali alikuwa akiwategemea wazazi kwa ushauri na maclekezo, sasa ndiye aliyetarajiwa kuwa mshauri na mwelekezi wa familia yake. Majukumu mengine ya kijamii pia yalimtumbulia macho. Pamoja na shughuli nyingi za kikazi, desturi zajamii yake zilimhitaji kushirikiana na wanajamii wenzake kwa hali na mali. Ingawa Shawe alikuwa mkono wazi, alihisi kuwa hakuwa na muda wa kutosha kutangamana na wanajamii wenzake&nbsp;katika shughuli kama vile kudumisha usalama, sherehe&nbsp;za posa na haﬂa za kuchangia elimu ya watoto maskini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Mkewe Shawe alijaribu kumrai atenge muda, hasa mwishoni mwa wiki, kuingiliana na wanajamii wengine lakini kila mara Shawe alilalamikia hili na lil&eacute; akisema kwamba ametingwa na kazi. Palipotokea haja ya kifedha, Shawe hakuchelewa kutoa mchango wake. Hakika hata alitoa pesa kila mwezi kukuza hazina ya Chama Cha Masilahi Ya Mtaa alikoishi. Mkewe alikerwa mno na hali hii na kumkumbusha kila mara kuwa pesa hununua; hazitumwi. Wanakijiji nao, pamoja na kwamba walitambua na kuienzi michango yake ya kifedha, walihisi kwamba Shawe anajitenga nao. Kulingana nao, Shawe aliwanyima fursa ya kufaidika kwa kipawa chake cha uongozi. Walimtumia mjumbe, si mara moja, si mara mbili kuhusu hali hii. Shawe: ambaye alikuwa amedidimia zaidi katika kazi yake&nbsp;alikiona kitendo cha wanakijiji kama usumbufu. &ldquo;<strong>Mimi hutuma michango yangu kila mara wanapoihitaji, wanataka nini zaidi?&rdquo; </strong>alisema Shawe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir="ltr">Siku moja Shawe alikuja kutambua maana ya methali, &lsquo;Kinyozi hajinyoi&rsquo;. Kifungua mimba wake aliamua kuuasi ukapera, akamtaka babake kupeleka posa kwa mchumba wake. Kama ilivyokuwa desturi, Shawe alihitaji kuandamana na wazee na akina mama katika shughuli hii. Alimtuma mkewe kumjuza kinara wa baraza la ukoo pamoja na mwcnyekiti Wa Chama Cha Masilahi Ya Mtaani. Viongozi hawa walipopata ujumbe huo, walitabasamu tu, wakawakusanya wanachama wao kuwapasha habari, wanachama wakafurahi kwamba mtoto anapatajiko. Walikusanya pesa na kumtumia Shawe kupitia kwa mkewe huku kila mmoja wao akituma udhuru wa kutohudhuria. Shawe alipokea bahasha iliyosetiri kibunda cha pesa kutoka kwa mkewe, akazitazama kwa masikitiko makuu huku amejiinamia kwa fedheha. Lilikuwa pigo lililohitaji moyo wajiwe kulikabili.</p>\r\n',created:"2016-10-28T09:23:38.576060Z",subject:4,exam:139}],name:"Kiswahili KCPE

Yumkini jibu lako kwa swali hili litadhihirisha kwamba asilimia kubwa ya wanafunzi hutembea kwenda shuleni, wengine hutumia baiskeli, magari ya umma na ya kibinafsi, pikipiki na garimoshi. Bila shaka aina ya usaﬁri hutofautiana kulingana na uwezo wa kiuchumi na umbali baina ya nyumbani kwa mwanafunzi na shule yake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kila aina ya usaﬁri ina changamoto maalum. Mathalani ikiwa umezungumza na wenzako ambao hutembea kwenda shuleni, haikosi wamekuuezea dhiki wanazokumbana nazo. Licha ya safari za aina hii kuwachosha wanaunzi, ni wazi kuwa wanafunzi wengine hata hukosa masomo kwa sababu ya kutopitika kwa njia wakati wa mvua nyingi. Pengine hata wewe umewahi kujipata katika njia panda baada ya daraja unalovukia kusombwa na maji ya mto uliofurika. Isitoshe, watembeao huweza kuathirika kiafya wakati wa kipupwe. Baridi huweza kﬁwasababishia pumu au hata kichomi. Wengine huwa katika hatari ya kuteleza kwenye&nbsp;njia zenye matope na kuvunjika viungo vya mwili. Hawa pia wamo katika hatari zaidi ya kutekwa nyara na hata kunyanyaswa kimapenzi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wanafunzi wengine <strong>huwahusudu</strong> wale ambao husaﬁri shuleni, ama kwa gari la shule, au la kibinafsi. Wakiulizwa kuhusu kiini cha husuda hii, wanasema kwamba wenzao hawa hawachoki kwani magari haya yanawachukua kutoka malangoni mwa nyumba zao. Hata hivyo, ukichunguza vyema utapata kwamba hata hawa wana matatizo sugu. Kwa vile magari ya shule huwabeba wanafunzi kutoka sehemu mbalimbali, magari haya hayana budi kuanza safari mapema. Hili huwalazimu wanafunzi nao kuamka alfajiri na mapema ili kuyawahi magari haya. Matokeo ni kwamba wanafunzi wengi hawadiriki kulala usingizi wa kutosha. Kuna wale ambao hulala saa nne usiku baada ya kukamilisha kazi za darasani, kisha wanaraushwa saa kumi ili kujitayarishia basi la saa kumi na moja. Wanafunzi wa aina hii hukumbwa na uchovu, na bila shaka husinzia darasani.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isitoshe, wanafunzi wanaotumia usaﬁri wa umma hulalamikia msongamano wa magari ambao unawafanya kukawia njiani, na hata kupewa adhabu kwa kuchelewa kuﬁka shuleni. Wengine hata hukataliwa na magari ya abiria, eti wanalipa fedha kidogo, na kuwasababishia wenye magari hasara. Wanafunzi hawa huaibika na kulazimika kutembea hadi shuleni. Hali kadhalika, magari ya umma humpa mwanafunzi mazingira ya kujifunzia tabia; nzuri na mbaya. Pamoja na wanafunzi hawa kupata fursa ya kutangamana na wenzao kutoka shule nyingine, wao pia huweza kuathiriwa vibaya na hulka za wasafari wengine. Kuna wale ambao huiga lugha, mitindo ya mavazi, namna ya kutembea, na hata mienendo mingine ya madereva na utingo. Wengine huishia kuwa waraibu sugu wa vileo kutokana na vielelezo wanavyopata kwenye&nbsp;magari haya. Muziki, picha za video, na mazungumzo kupitia vyombo vya habari vilivyo kwenye magari haya huchangia kuzorotesha tabia ya wanafunzi. Hii ni kwa sababu baadhi ya masuala yanayozungumziwa ni ya aibu na hayapaswi kusikilizwa na watu wa umri mbichi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ni dhahiri kwamba kila aina ya usaﬁri ina athari zake. Hata hivyo, Baniani mbaya kiatu chake dawa. Usaﬁri unahitajika katika kufanikisha masomo ya wanafunzi, na katika uchukuzi wa bidhaa na vifaa mbalimbali ambavyo wanahitaji shuleni. Ni jukumu la kila mwanajamii kuhakikisha kwamba mikakati ifaayo imewekwa ili&nbsp;kukinga dhidi ya madhara yanayoandamana na kila aina ya usaﬁri. Wanafunzi nao wakae ange kutambua watu ambao huenda wakawatosa katika maovu.

Hakika hata waliwahimiza watoto wao kuiga mfano wa simba na ﬁsi. Kilichowavutia wanyama zaidi ni hulka ya simba na ﬁsi kuchuma pamoja na kuzikimu familia zao pamoja.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hali iliendelea hivyo hadi wakati simba na ﬁsi walipojifungua vitinda mimba wao. Uzazi huu ulisababisha mabadiliko makubwa katika maisha yao. Licha ya uzee uliokuwa umebisha hodi, simba na ﬁsi walikuwa na vinywa zaidi vya kulisha. Kadhalika, vitoto hivi vikembe vilihitaji uangalizi zaidi, havingeweza kuachiwa ndugu zao. Hali hii iliwafanya wasiweze kuandamana usasini. Waliaﬁkiana kupishana zamu katika majukumu yao. Wakati ambapo simba angeenda kuwinda, ﬁsi angebaki nyumbani akiwatunza watoto. Zipo baadhi ya nyakati, japo kwa nadra mno, ﬁsi alipojitolea kwenda kuwinda.

Simba naye alizidi kumshuku ﬁsi. Hata hivyo alipoendelea kuuliza kuhusu muujiza wa kutoweka kwa chakula, ﬁsi alimlaghai kwamba kwa kweli chakula kilikuwa kikichukuliwa na simba jike mwingine aliyekuwa akiishi ziwani. Hili lilimchemsha simba roho, akakata shauri kwenda moja kwa moja kukabiliana na hasidi huyo. Simba alisimama ukingoni mwa ziwa huku akiyatazama maji yaliyomlia kana kwamba yanamwogopa. Mbele yake, ndani ya maji, alimwona simba jike mwenzake aliyefanana naye kama shilingi kwa ya pili.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Kumbe ni kweli kuwa dada yangu huyu hutuendea kinyume? </strong>Kumbe huyu ndiyo anayetaka kuutia ufa udugu baina yangu nzi ﬁsi?&rdquo; simba alijiuliza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simba hakujua vipi, lakini alijipata ndani ya ziwa; hasira imemtuma kupambana na simba jike mwenzake. Alitwaa mafumba yake kumchanachana huyo simba, lakini lo! Alijipata anakipiga kivuli chake pambaja majini. Haukupita muda mrefu kabla ya simba kuhisi mng&#39;ato mkali kwenye mguu wake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alipotazama alimwona mamba mkubwa ajabu anaendelea kungw&#39;afua minofu ya nyama kutoka pajani mwake. Alitaka kutoa ukemi lakini akajiasa. &quot;Simba haonyeshi maumivu hata mbele ya matatizo makubwa. Huku kutakuwa kujidhalilisha.&quot; simba alijisemea. Baadaye alimrukia mamba kwa hamasa kuu moto wa mapigano ukawaka. Mapambano yalipokatika, wawili hawa walikuwa wamehasirika si haba. Simba alikuwa amedhooﬁka mguu naye mamba akabaki na kigutu cha mkia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simba aliﬁka nyumbani akiwa hoi kwa maumivu, majonzi na kukatika tamaa.
